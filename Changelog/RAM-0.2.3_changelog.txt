			[e15d1c0](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/e15d1c0d274fb9a9467654060e5e4aefbd516b5d)- Make sure our fluids have an overlay (for now just use water's), so that they look decent when against glass. Also make our glass styled blocks use the overlay so that they look nice under water[#5840](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5840)[24d06a8](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/24d06a89ff8ff66fc9f3044b685cae0383d5b8fa)- Fix a few tiles for reactor's being marked as "invalid" for the block they are for due to forgetting to give them the correct block[ed992db](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ed992db0a2f438aad24e94b9cd969d76f3e20268)- Make our recipe type's toString method return the registry name, as this is likely what vanilla is doing when I copied their implementation and I had forgotten that creating a resource location with no domain automatically adds minecraft to it. CrT for its json integration uses the toString method to figure out the name to use for the serializer[https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/issues/927](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/issues/927)[6b60eea](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/6b60eea3940e1a4cbcb0199d7d7739458cbc4942)- Cherry pick minor parts of[https://github.com/pupnewfster/Mekanism/commit/ee51172caad9de914e3d21634c47c6c92cecdf07](https://github.com/pupnewfster/Mekanism/commit/ee51172caad9de914e3d21634c47c6c92cecdf07)to cleanup the handling of fluids and chemicals over the network[c9154b4](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/c9154b40a1a588f469c30d0fef1e6bacb317a663)- Cleanup/fix how we distribute some of the packets[8fb41af](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8fb41af04b7a3744b678959218b72c92a584c0c2)- Fix extracting from public personal chests from the bottom face[#5859](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5859)[06d7b80](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/06d7b80461f8b2099dcaadd8f7416bbd257c940c)- update zh_tw ([#5856](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5856))[1a42e18](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1a42e182aaffcb557c9af1711d991902db5aba6d)- Remove old .lang file for zh_tw[d8131e5](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/d8131e55e112af4594d1663dd96e7abfac7ef76c)- Use ITeleporter again to properly set various elements when changing dimensions, and unify some entity and player teleportation code[#5857](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5857)[ac032d2](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ac032d2aae82ef4306746301a91ba0fcb62693f2)- Remove no longer used packet[4848caf](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4848caf6c33ff7b8afb4f7c58b1712e43a171084)- Cleanup how we make the robit's light and eyes glow, and also fix the robit rendering facing the opposite direction the robit was actually facing[05ec560](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/05ec5603a2cf24495173887f2bfaba729c741a07)- Finish converting the robit's smelting interface to use the energized smelter's recipe list and recipe system. It still could use some cleanup but for the most part it works properly now[569947d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/569947daed2a347a3012c1ecd0e4e952bf3afd1f)- Start work on rewriting the back end of how data is synced to the client in regards to containers. When finished this system should reduce both packet frequency and overall size of packets sent to players with mekanism containers open[dbbc0bb](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/dbbc0bbf209be6275312292f42d6ee8219dda654)- Cleanup a bit more of the backend and create a system to batch updates that happened at the same time into a single packet. Also create classes for making it easier to sync, fluid stacks, gas stacks, and infusion stacks.[c1e46e3](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/c1e46e3152f2b2592ec3ab961cb64ae5a0f08b93)- Fix side config not properly disabling capabilities when set to none.[#5864](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5864)[0eb5b3b](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/0eb5b3ba990d2ab93de2ec46b719cbf8fa42c348)- Run a block update when modifying a block's side config with a Configurator[e5c19ed](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/e5c19ed1bc2ae68ea939bc1447c47be9b8959308)- Re-implement Configurator rotation This was only meant to be used for Mekanism machines, hence the hard check for Mekanism tiles (line 155)[6a3602a](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/6a3602a12c0e561596438fe493b676a88af9cade)- Fix having forgotten to register a couple packets, and finish making it so factories have all their container sync stuff happen via the new syncing methods. Also fix a few issues with checking if a stack is dirty[7e3eea8](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/7e3eea830ffa3a76020e0d6e3aa84e8e4aa45f6d)- Improve build.gradle to only not cache the mods.toml file instead of all resources[4f72570](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4f72570fba0f46c516c7ded09f060230bf6b5000)- Convert the upgrades gui to being synced via the new container sync system. We still for now manually sync any muffling upgrades when that amount changes, as the client cares about the number of muffling upgrades even when not in the gui. Also fix installing/removing muffling upgrades not properly updating the sound in a world that has daylight cycle disabled[6103719](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/6103719acffc13aa88b42482a09218c4df6ca9cd)- Make it a bit easier for containers to manage/sync enums and fix the security mode in factories not being properly synced/updated[ca25869](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ca25869fbccf6132641f0fecb5e6b1b6d700f447)- Only sync amount for fluid and chemical stacks when the type did not change.[886d878](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/886d8782f532c79e85ecebcaa1f8b34a8a304c77)- Cleanup code pertaining to factories: - Remove RecipeType (in favor of FactoryType) - Remove the ability to change the type of an existing factory, as factories no longer all have the same number of slots or even chemical tanks. Note: For now the recipe type slots are still being internally added for purposes of not breaking inventory loading until the next time we end up breaking it anyways - Moved the factories' gas and infusion tanks to the proper subclasses[cf7eaed](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/cf7eaedebf884b1d5c76eba390c87ca8d0b3ceb3)- Fix not taking speed upgrade changes into account for secondary energy per tick[1c63d26](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1c63d267adc3a6cc389150309636e968e08bc283)- Fix Entangloporter model, make Entangloporter update neighbors when toggling frequencies for transmitter connectivity[3cf78ff](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/3cf78ff8b0be953b5d50d40641db2401c4cc6222)- Do some cleanup reducing the number of individual classes needed for new container types, and instead have them just be MekanismTileContainer's directly[68cd490](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/68cd490f56dbcfe112cc134504afb45717dfab93)- Fix quantum entangloporter item transport[54bd60d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/54bd60d2a67df23563c75b522876d11abb5f58ba)- Fix a few transporter filters trying to initialize the stack preview before a filter is set[#5863](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5863)[169825c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/169825c6c25b2351670d1a298cc84b82b03b483f)- Reimplement trusted security mode making it store things based off of UUIDs rather than names. This will make it so that it can be properly persistent if a user changes their name[#5861](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5861)[bbfeb76](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/bbfeb7685898631e5b5ce00948caab0bc0aeb1be)- Fixed Seismic Reader ([#5835](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5835)), fix QE crash[60ae332](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/60ae33298f5a86fa7fcd7dfb1c825e97739df7de)- Fix insert prediction not taking into account the type of items we already have en route to a slot.[#5865](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5865)[c717de3](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/c717de3da84eb1432d6e42c4ce051cd44f058b82)- Fix GuiScrollList drag scrolling[ba352d9](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ba352d9e7493f59c5b9f1f1e1f2e80dc89ee8c35)- Fix frequencies not consistently saving to the same world, now they save to the overworld given they are global anyways. Also fixed the FrequencyManagers being reset before saving, thus causing no frequencies to be properly persisted.[#5868](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5868)[8b3b40c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8b3b40cc343be0c9c7de1e842c4dd006ce932540)- Fixed Security Desk item render[452395c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/452395cea54578d96b3382567a0890d7ed9508d7)- Triple heat boost from adjacent lava for Heat Generator[1be6c54](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1be6c543c1e84cc057faf5e3a2e0f9ba5f3e26b6)- Fix JEI for many machines[fb4e940](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/fb4e940d1b14e12e32a66e315b57284b18b9b3cf)- Cleanup a bit of code for sending packets to player's using tiles to only have to create the packet a single time, and only do so if there are players using it[9b537d6](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/9b537d66cdc643da9d7fe51a31cfefddf7a4441e)- Reformat code and cleanup unused imports, and unflatten some imports that got combined into *[ec4f62e](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ec4f62e74af6c98888d0c3301a85a8094513646f)- Cleanup various parts of the code having to do with container syncing moving our various tiles to our new syncing system. - Fixed a few block state/model files where we were accidentally still trying to use forge's blockstate texture override system - Added support for syncing item stacks via our container sync system[8039387](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8039387abd236f97acb4d1421e8dadc1955724a0)- Minor cleanup to the formulaic assemblicator[6f86594](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/6f86594595aaf32b889f3bc9b89fa59282a2c5b9)- Fix thermal evaporation controller not changing textures[94c8539](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/94c853990f672da1e06507c1b88cd2b49fdab06c)- Fix bug introduced when fixing controller texture, causing incorrect calculations to take place when it is initially loaded as "active". Also fixes the issue of the thermal evaporation plant incorrectly taking temperature into consideration[#5832](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5832)[9468385](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/94683852df844930c94f4e78952293d15bfbebe6)- Fix accidental removal of a few set's being linked.

		v20.3.0 for Minecraft 1.15.2:
			* Reworked minimap writing to work on the main game thread. Can negatively (or positively) affect the performance a bit depending on your computer specs but it's worth it for stability reasons (especially when playing with a lot of other mods). This change should fix a lot of incompatibility-based crashes. A similar change is coming to the world map mod in the future. * Minimap writer optimization.

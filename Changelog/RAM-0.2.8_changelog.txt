		Mekanism-1.15.2-9.9.16.408.jar:
			Warning: Mekanism is currently in alpha, and is not recommended for widespread use in modpacks. There are likely to be game breaking bugs, and updating from one alpha to the next may cause various mekanism blocks to disappear/void their contents. While we will try to not have this happen/keep it to a minimum make sure to make backups. You can read more about the alpha state of this project [here](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism#alpha-status).
			[8cfe2a4](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8cfe2a45b9d1abb719ff85b2b78fb055c4c82f8f) - Fix ore/resource harvest levels ([#5942](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5942)), fix Paxel harvest levels [7923962](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/79239628b9c6f2fc5d7f6a4aadca443678c35dd9) - Hopefully fix transmitter model issues ([#5922](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5922)), remove client-side markDirty() call We used to call markDirty() on the client as it would trigger an all-sides neighbor update which was necessary for some kind of multi-mod interaction. It's not relevant anymore though as far as I can tell, especially since we have an internal markDirty() impl which prevents such updates. [c8476c1](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/c8476c1cb98c2822ad4118db3039d7ea8e1981db) - Fix harvest level changes [7e9ff56](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/7e9ff5615b782c192f1caad4ae4d635cc1f6ac75) - Initial experimenting with using vanilla's sync/update packet system rather than our own [8ff4379](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8ff4379299ee41208fb549ac3664bd2f8946d159) - Move all NBT keys to strings. Some things got renamed so various misc things may be voided from Mekanism machines/blocks so I would recommend emptying things just to be on the safe side. In some cases it will just be machine configurations that get reset. Also changed how the chunk loader component saves chunk positions, so you may have to go and reload the chunks to get them to stay loaded again. Things with bounding blocks like digital miners, advanced solar generators, security desks may unbind the bounding block from the actual main block, so should probably be broken/picked up before updating [b387c94](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/b387c94c1c2ee214d62feaad17e2bfb7ae71bbdb) - Move JSON string key constants to constants to make it easier to prevent typos and if there are typos at least have them be consistent throughout serialization and deserialization. No current recipes should break as nothing has been renamed. [006dbe6](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/006dbe6ce19672947b8f0b7a974cf9801989b923) - Only sync the energy scale to clients for energy cubes unless the gui is open [03738bd](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/03738bd2d0c29ebd4deebed92928a125f424c197) - Fix Gas Generator sound, fix Gas Generator 'burn rate' readout ([#5047](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5047)) [ce6aec5](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ce6aec58ac0435b616a6229a9cdd2aafbf463e1c) - Start converting more tiles to syncing stuff via vanilla's packet system. Also fix the Bio generator processing stuff on both the client and the server instead of just the server [1e3592b](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1e3592b2418821a765817746e330d18ed4bb3e66) - Finish converting ITileComponents over to properly syncing their data [7c0f0cd](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/7c0f0cd7b706321fc576e169805d69bef5b58e07) - Fix transmitters not checking bounds prior to placement, fix PRC GUI title [17019a8](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/17019a84fdc7580acdd4d649b898f7bd72a77fce) - Cleanup some code pertaining to inventory ejecting, ensuring we grab items based on what can be extracted rather than what is directly in the slot.

[6371faa](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/6371faa6f4553b0cfee8031941f48eb19ea3190b) - Fix a potential issue with active state changes [1951d1a](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1951d1a6706f5731c57162cdffe37d3f5c9cebe0) - Update machine lighting on world load [4c88139](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4c88139a7bdf20fb1d2bd9db7db7258564be1348) - Work on moving transmitters to syncing their initial data via vanilla's update packet [4f5822e](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4f5822e019f8c77d97fa3130a315907068900dd9) - Work on moving the security desk to using vanilla's update packet and our container sync system. We still need to properly move over syncing the trusted players list [e25085c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/e25085c71651702863446a3e12b661af51660b36) - Create system for syncing lists as elements in containers [1fc912d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1fc912d362a38a651af7dd9e6131cd0c304feaac) - Move evap controller and resistive heater over to vanilla update packets [9527146](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/952714684f1ea5c04c38d8b5aee9c8ad729fb63d) - Create a way to sync filter lists for containers - Cleanup some code pertaining to filters - Compare hashcode of list to check if it is dirty rather than comparing all the elements - Make HashList implement the List spec - Fixed error in loading frequencies [0294ecf](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/0294ecf009209a61d2986f7d841e206f5fe6fd65) - Move fluid tank syncing to vanilla packet system, and cleanup implementation of lasers and move that stuff over to the new method of handling sync data [757ed70](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/757ed709cca79913d78a99e31bb26f081b850264) - Switch induction matrix over to using vanilla sync packets and the container sync system [723c950](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/723c95054df89fa3bde59c83fe6772cfcf52dba9) - Convert dynamic tank, and internal multiblocks to using vanilla update packets, and our container sync system.

Also move the scale calculation to a util method to ensure that we render at least something if there is any contents [7ebe623](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/7ebe623a8200dd93a0dfceb7113cbd9cb0b41cba) - Use our own sync packet to avoid chunk rendering thrashing [9bedc8b](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/9bedc8b6c7a7592ade21b5de7641909ce61d7a57) - Add support for showing how much time our TERs are taking in the debug pie chart for block entities [324382d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/324382d148f884ad8314c5eb3b767d021ce3105c) - Convert reactor over to using the new sync system, and fix the normal laser always firing the max amount of power even when it didn't have that much power stored [c27ebf3](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/c27ebf301e11adff738d2920bc828d5cb7801fd8) - Move syncing of formula to our container sync system, and fix a few different issues with rendering of specific gui pieces [4c490e2](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4c490e27155dbf3bdd2bc8e692168b4832432927) - Switch steam tanks for the turbine, reactor, and boiler to be gas tanks and use the gas variant of steam, rather than fluid tanks using "liquid steam" - Add in scale target for the steam rendering of the turbine and boiler so that we don't have to send an update packet every time the stored amount changes by a single mb - Fixed reactor active state - Fix reactor not actually using any inputs [eb2d176](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/eb2d176996b33cb91f80e75998ec99d99dbaa000) - Remove specific implementation of a few interfaces when the super class already implements them [7facb95](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/7facb956203e6f15b0227c40c4b306f81797c3bd) - Only sync different gui information for multiblocks when the correct tab is being displayed [361fbf9](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/361fbf93da4774bbebef6dbb5e52d04977c41e73) - Always send the structure if the multiblock tile is rendering.

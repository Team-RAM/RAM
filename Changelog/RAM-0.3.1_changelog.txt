			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).
			## [1.6.3] - 2020-05-07
			### Changed
			* Shield durability is now based on the "armor durability" stat. Iron shields should be the same durability as vanilla shields.
			* Reworked the way stat modifiers are read from part JSONs. Old files are still compatible. New style is less verbose.
			### Fixed
			* Shield models in wrong location (Partonetrain) [#117]
			* Shields not having any color [#114]
			* Netherwood sticks will no longer lower durability below 20
			* Multiple modifiers on a single stat for a part not working
			## [1.6.2] - 2020-05-02
			### Fixed
			* Possible crash with armor and Quark [#115]
			* Possible solution for CME in PartManager [#104]
			* "Add harvest level" stat modifiers not working (ornate gold rod from SGems). This moves the "max" operation to right after the "avg" operation. Shouldn't effect stat calculations in most other cases. [#70]
			* Armor showing "When in main hand" in tooltip
			## [1.6.1] - 2020-04-27
			### Added
			* Paxels are back! Requires 5 mains and a rod. Small durability bonus, small penalty to harvest speed and enchantability. [#114]

			### Fixed
			* Netherwood trees not spawning [#110]
			* A possible lumber axe crash when used on large trees [#84]
			* (API) `PartData.onAddedToGear` being called too often [[Super Multi-Drills #19]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19))]
			## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-20
			### Added

			### Changed
			* Move all gear crafting recipes to their own tab in JEI [#106]
			* (API) PartTypes can now specify a fallback part, deprecates `PartManager.tryGetFallback`
			* (API) Gear class maps in ModItems now use ResourceLocations for keys, to allow other mods to add gear types
			### Fixed
			* Swapping gear parts will now attempt to return the replaced parts in the crafting grid
			* Part names being underlined after viewing them in the parts menu
			* Gear randomizer not selecting parts in some cases
			* Random gear command not working with command blocks
			* Salvager attaching grade NBT to returned items
			## [1.5.8] - 2020-04-15
			### Fixed
			* Server crash caused by new command added in 1.5.7 [#112]
			* Issues with armor coloring being incorrect, adds a couple new texture properties to part JSONs (see [Silent's Gems #454]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454)))
			* `armor_color` - The color of the armor model (defaults to `fallback_color`)
			* `armor_texture` - The prefix of the armor texture path (defaults to `texture_suffix`)
			* You can leave these new properties out (default) in most cases
			* This fix disables color blending for armor models (items will still show blending)
			## [1.5.7] - 2020-04-12
			Requires Forge 31.1.18 or higher
			### Added
			* Command to show parts GUI (`/sgear_parts show_gui`). Does not require OP perms. [#107]

			### Fixed
			* Upgrade parts applying to invalid gear items
			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed

			### Fixed
			* Hidden parts appearing on the parts screen in the crafting station
			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19
			### Added
			* Gear name prefixes. Can be added to individual parts (see rough rods for any example), or through an event (GearNamePrefixesEvent)
			### Changed
			* Mine and Slash random drops are now tier 1 minimum
			* Mine and Slash random drops should now be salvagable
			### Fixed
			* Hammer dupe [#51]
			* JEI failing to load on servers [#52]

			## [1.3.8] - 2019-08-13
			### Fixed
			* Mine and Slash compatibility race condition
			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added
			* Basic compatibility for Mine and Slash
			### Fixed
			* Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12

			* Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			* Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			* Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			## [1.4.2] - 2019-09-29
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart#onGearDamaged`

			### Fixed
			* Upgrade parts applying to invalid gear items
			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed
			* Data paths for parts and traits changed. silentgear/parts is now silentgear_parts and silentgear/traits is now silentgear_traits. Files in the old location will still load for now.
			### Fixed
			* Hidden parts appearing on the parts screen in the crafting station
			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19
			### Added
			* Gear name prefixes. Can be added to individual parts (see rough rods for any example), or through an event (GearNamePrefixesEvent)
			### Changed
			* Mine and Slash random drops are now tier 1 minimum
			* Mine and Slash random drops should now be salvagable
			### Fixed
			* Hammer dupe [#51]

			## [1.3.8] - 2019-08-13
			### Fixed

			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added
			* Basic compatibility for Mine and Slash
			### Fixed
			* Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12
			### Added

			* Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			* Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			* Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30

			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22

			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.

			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed

			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues

			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed

			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed

			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed

			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19

			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17

This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/&lt;namespace&gt;/silentgear/parts/`, where `&lt;namespace&gt;` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed

			### Fixed
			* Hidden parts appearing on the parts screen in the crafting station
			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19
			### Added
			* Gear name prefixes. Can be added to individual parts (see rough rods for any example), or through an event (GearNamePrefixesEvent)
			### Changed

			* Mine and Slash random drops should now be salvagable
			### Fixed

			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added

			### Fixed
			* Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12

			* Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			* Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			* Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated.

			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/&lt;namespace&gt;/silentgear/parts/`, where `&lt;namespace&gt;` is a unique ID for your datapack.

			## [3.4.3] - 2019-09-27
			### Added
			* Chaos Purifier, consumes purifying powder to remove chaos from the world. Will not reduce chaos below the equilibrium level. Useful if you accidentally leaked a lot of chaos into the world.
			* Tooltip to ender crystals describing how to get them
			* Ender crystals can now appear in some loot chests (somewhat rare)
			* Harvest level tooltips to ores
			* Silent's Mechanisms crusher recipe for ender ore

			* Slime crystal, magma cream crystal, and ender slime crystal (catalyst for gem transmutations)
			* Transmutation altar textures
			* More advancements!
			* Chaos sickness chaos event. Applies some negative effects based on chaos levels, as well as a "chaos sickness" effect which just serves as an indicator.
			### Changed
			* Increase regional gem types from 2-4 to 4-6 (should make finding Nether/End gems a bit easier)
			### Fixed
			* Fix crash when using Naturally Charged Creepers [#406]
			## [3.3.13] - 2019-09-11
			### Changed
			* Adds a more helpful message to the ChaosSourceCapability crash, which should help point users in the correct direction. This is usually caused by client-side mods on the server.
			* Update required version of Silent Lib to 4.3.2 in mods.toml
			## [3.3.12] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed
			* (API) IPedestalItem is now a capability
			### Fixed
			* Token enchanter not consuming ingredients [#403]
			* Chaos event configs being ignored [#402]
			* Sound type of fluffy puff plants
			* Required Forge version range (92+)
			## [3.3.11] - 2019-09-05
			### Added
			* Configs to disable individual chaos events. Note that disabling events will likely increase the odds of other events occurring. Does not effect events triggered by commands.
			* New lightning event which spawns a series of lightning bolts which do NOT ignite fires. ID is `silentgems:chaos_lightning`. The old event has been renamed to `silentgems:lightning`.
			### Fixed
			* Gem glass on wrong render layer
			* Unlinked redstone teleporters throwing an exception when powered [#395]
			## [3.3.10]
			### Added
			* Transmutation altar. Processes recipes that take one input, one catalyst (not consumed), and produces one output. Generates chaos when working. Recipes can be added with data packs.
			### Changed
			* Nether star shards are produced in the transmutation altar now (resolves potential conflicts)
			### Fixed
			* Enchantment token crash with mod-added enchantment types [#394]

			### Changed
			* Nerfed persistence trait (it was ticking much more often than intended)
			## [3.3.6] - 2019-08-13
			### Changed
			* Rebalanced chaos values for events. World chaos is once again added to player chaos, but with some exceptions. If player chaos is low and world chaos is high, the world chaos is replaced with the current equilibrium level. This should allow wisps to spawn rarely for players who are not producing chaos. Most events have too high of a minimum to trigger on the equilibrium level alone.
			### Fixed
			* Chaos rune recipes not producing valid runes
			* Empty pedestals absorbing chaos
			* Crash when placing soul urns in place of tall grass
			## [3.3.5] - 2019-08-12
			### Added
			* Cooldown timers to chaos events. Varies by event, from around 30 seconds to 20 minutes. Once an event is triggered for a player, the same event cannot trigger again until the cooldown expires. These timers are not stored in NBT, so they will reset when the game/server is restarted.
			* Some return home charm config options
			* Option to restrict to teleporters of the same gem (disabled by default)
			* Option to allow binding to anchors (enabled by default)
			* Option to set max uses (0/unlimited by default)
			* Amazonite gear part (Slurpie's Dongles)
			### Changed
			* Rebalanced some chaos-related stuff again
			* Wisps should be less common (min chaos 200k)
			* Corrupted blocks should be slightly more common (min chaos 750k)
			* Events are now rolled every second (up from every 5), makes cooldown times more sensible
			* Reduced chance of fire/lightning wisp shots lighting blocks on fires
			### Fixed
			* World chaos affecting chaos events for all players
			## [3.3.4] - 2019-08-11
			### Fixed
			* Crash when breaking soul urns [#391]
			## [3.3.3] - 2019-08-11

			* Thunderstorm chaos event (very low probability, minimum 1 million chaos)
			### Changed

			* Lidless soul urn items not rendering correctly
			* Supercharger processing items that are already supercharged
			* HWYLA reporting the names of gem blocks incorrectly [#390]
			* Wisps trying to spawn on peaceful difficulty
			## [3.3.2] - 2019-08-06
			### Changed

			### Fixed
			* Recipe book crash on Forge 28.0.28+ [#385]

			## [3.3.1] - 2019-07-28

			## [3.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			### Added
			* A new set of hostile mobs, wisps. These will occasionally spawn on the surface near the player, depending on chaos levels. There are a few different types, each firing a projectile with a different effect.
			* Chaos meter item. Measures player and world chaos levels, sneak + right-click to change modes.
			* Config to override the "base biome seed", which will change which biomes gems will spawn in.
			* Tags for corruptable stone/dirt
			* Missing textures and models for corrupted piles and corrupting/purifying powder
			* Corrupting/purifying powder to some chest loot tables
			### Changed
			* Log biomes for gems in a more compact more, should appear in latest.log
			* Default soul urn capacity is now 54 (6 rows), upgrade has no effect right now
			* Sol and Luna traits now deal much more bonus damage, but with only a 25% chance of activating. Added knockback to sol/luna procs.
			### Fixed
			* Secret donuts kicking players from servers [#381]
			## [3.2.2] - 2019-07-05
			### Changed

			* Information on chaos buffs (runes for chaos gems) is now synced with the client
			## [3.2.1] - 2019-07-03

			## [3.2.0] - 2019-07-01

			### Added
			* Gems added to some loot tables
			### Fixed
			* Teleporters and return home charms not working
			## [3.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* Treasure Bags support (adds bags for gem sets, no way to obtain aside from commands yet)
			* A new command, `sg_soul`. Can currently be used to give soul gems or get a list of all registered souls.
			### Changed
			* Token enchanter recipes now use the vanilla recipe system, so they have moved to the recipes folder. `type` is `silentgems:token_enchanting`, the format is the same otherwise.
			* Updated gem shard textures
			### Fixed
			* Soul gem ingredient not working correctly
			## [3.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			(would have been 3.1.1, Git had other plans)
			Minimum Silent Gear version: 1.1.2
			### Added
			* Gem geodes are back. These are deposits of gems that are encased in hardened rock. There are classic, dark, and light variants, all found in the overworld.
			* Gem ores in the Nether and The End now spawn in "regions", similar to old optional configs. Each region will have 2-4 types of gems.
			* Dark and light glowroses now spawn in the Nether and The End, respectively
			* Implemented traits (some traits are still missing effects)
			* Chaotic - generates chaos when used
			* Entropy - increases block breaking speed depending on chaos levels
			* Luna - attacks deal more damage at night (cancels with Sol)
			* Persistence - slow self-repair

			* Sol - attacks deal more damage during the day (cancels with Luna)
			### Changed

			* Gear souls no longer gain the armor trait unless on an armor item
			### Fixed

			## [3.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for ender slime spawns are back
			* Recipe advancements for most items (except gem stuff)
			## [3.0.12] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* Silver
			* Corrupting powder and purifying powder. These will create corrupted blocks, or restore them to their normal state. Recipes subject to change.
			### Changed
			* World chaos will now balance at a certain level, instead of zero. The level fluctuates over time.
			* Wild fluffy puff plants will only drop seeds now
			### Fixed
			* Possible fix for [#366]
			* Crash when Silent Gear not installed [#365]
			* Server crash
			## [3.0.11] - 2019-04-14
			### Added
			* Granite, diorite, andesite, and obsidian pedestals. Obsidian pedestal is black-resistant.
			* Chaos gems placed on pedestals will apply effects to nearby players, if enabled. The chaos produced is reduced slightly when applied to multiple players. Chaos gems can be enabled/disabled with redstone.
			* JEI plugin is back
			* Supercharger JEI support, also shows the blocks required for different pillar tiers
			* Token enchanter JEI support
			* Couple of advancements for pedestals
			* (API) IPedestalItem, allows items to be ticked when placed on pedestals
			### Removed
			* Unneeded block items (blocks you would normally never see in your inventory)
			### Changed
			* Pedestals can now accept a redstone signal to control some items.
			* Rebalanced chaos buff costs
			* Add leakage rate to chaos orb tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Pedestals not showing items on world load. Currently fixing this by just sending an update packet occasionally, so you may need to wait a few seconds.
			* Various localization errors
			## [3.0.10] - 2019-04-12
			Add some traits to some gems (still working on this). Many of the new traits do nothing right now.
			### Added
			* Chaos orbs are back. They absorb chaos, but efficiency varies. All orbs have a certain amount of "leakage". They can absorb a fixed amount of chaos, then they break.
			* Pedestals. Currently just a plain stone variety, will likely add more. Right-click to place/remove an item. Holds one item only.
			* Chaos orbs placed on pedestals will absorb chaos produced by nearby blocks
			* Config file (finally)
			### Changed
			* Glowroses spawn in sparser patches (you can tweak this in the config file). You can get the old behavior by setting `glowrose.world.placeTryCount` to 64 and maybe increase `glowrose.world.maxPerPatch`
			* Soul gem average drop rate reduced to 2.5% (from 3.5%). You can change this in the config file.
			## [3.0.9] - 2019-03-21
			### Added
			* Gear souls (formerly tool souls) are back! These work with Silent Gear items only. Soul skills are now learnable traits. Currently no way to customize the skill list, but it will likely happen. This means ANY trait could be made learnable, even user-defined traits.
			* New potion effects, grounded and insulated. These protect from the shocking and freezing effects (caused by the lightning/ice aspect enchantments). No way to get these effects yet.
			### Fixed
			* A server crash (EntityPlayerSP in ChaosGem)
			* Crash when Silent Gear is not loaded
			* Fluffy puffs not growing [#360]
			* Life Steal, Lightning Aspect, and Ice Aspect not working (Gravity still seems off)
			## [3.0.8] - 2019-03-16
			### Added
			* Chaos gems and chaos runes are back. Both are crafted in the token enchanter.
			* More advancements (supercharger pillar tiers, teleporters, and more)
			* Teleporter linker recipe
			* Ender slime spawns (plus spawn egg)
			### Changed
			* Enriched chaos crystals are now crafted in the token enchanter (same ingredients)
			* Reorganized some advancements
			### Fixed
			* "Modify soul urn" recipe is working again. Craft a soul urn with a gem or dyes to change its appearance. Dyeing working just like leather armor.
			* Chaos dust is now craftable (and therefore chaos iron)
			* Ender slime loot table
			## [3.0.7] - 2019-03-12
			### Fixed
			* Crash related to soul gems
			## [3.0.6] - 2019-03-12
			### Added
			* Teleporters are back.
			* Return home charms are back. Each gem variant is now a separate item.
			* Soul gems are back, with changes. A soul gem is automatically added for all living entities. Plant soul gems are gone. Elements are randomized and they will probably have nonsense names (TBD). The elements are meaningless until gear souls are added.
			* Soul gem ingredient for use in recipes. This allows vanilla shaped/shapeless recipes and token enchanter recipes to require a soul gem of a specific entity. See the wiki for details if you want to take advantage of this ~~(politely yell at me on Discord if I have forgotten to write the wiki page)~~.
			* You can now create spawn eggs in the token enchanter. Requires eggs, soul gems, and enriched chaos crystals (you can view the recipes in REI)
			* `sg_chaos` command can now target the world
			### Fixed
			* Ornate gold and silver rods crashing the game
			* `sg_chaos get` command now works correctly
			## [3.0.5] - 2019-03-09
			### Added
			* New chaos system. This is no longer an energy system, but more like a "pollution" system. Certain blocks and items (token enchanter, supercharger) will generate chaos. Chaos will dissipate naturally over time. Currently, there is no way to increase the dissipation rate. If chaos gets too high, you may see random lightning strikes or discover patches of corrupted stone or dirt underground. More effects are planned.
			* Token enchanter. This is the new way of creating enchantment tokens. It supports loading recipes from data packs (place the files in `data/*/silentgems/token_recipes`, where `*` is your data pack's namespace). These recipes are not limited to enchantment tokens, you could use it to create anything.
			* Partial REI support for token enchanter and supercharger. Speed crafting (shift-click to transfer ingredients) is _not_ supported at this time.
			* Wild fluffy puff plants to provide a source of seeds. Can be found in most (not all) biomes that get rain.
			* All foods have their respective effects again (try the donuts!)
			### Fixed
			* Gems missing rarity stat (Silent Gear) [#358]
			* Foods will return items again (sticks, bowls)
			## [3.0.4] - 2019-03-02
			### Added
			* Supercharger is back, along with full Silent Gear integration
			* Fluffy blocks are back
			* Advancements are back
			* Color handlers are back. Wrapped in a try-catch to (hopefully) prevent crashes.
			* Lots of missing recipes
			### Changed
			* Overhauled the localization file, minimizing duplication. Should make translating the mod easier.
			### Fixed
			* Soul urns should be fully functional (but cannot be crafted in survival due to lack of soul gem drops)
			* Ender crystal block effect was missing
			* Chaos coal blocks not working as fuel
			* Broken translations
			## [3.0.3] - 2019-02-24
			### Added
			* Null check for BlockColors and ItemColors. For some reason, these turn up null at random. This should prevent the crash when it happens but certain blocks or items may be missing their colors.
			## [3.0.2] - 2019-02-23
			### Added
			* Glowroses can now be planted in vanilla flower pots. This amplifies their light level to 15.
			* Chaos and Ender ore generation
			### Fixed
			* Nether and End gems not spawning. Currently, both will spawn multi-gem ore. The overworld still has biome-dependent spawns.
			* Glowrose hit box and collision fixed
			* Silent Gear part files corrected. These should function correctly whenever Gear is ready to release.
			## [3.0.1] - 2019-02-21
			### Fixed
			* Crash caused by a build error [#354]
			## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-21
			Ported to 1.13.2. This version will bring some major changes:
			* The Flattening has changed almost every block and item ID. Old worlds are not compatible.
			* Tools and armor have been removed.
			* For a similar system, check out Silent Gear.
			* I am considering a mod which will add simple, non-upgradeable gem tools.
			* The chaos system is gone, for now. I am working on an alternative. Chaos was never intended to be an energy system and I hope to make it into something more interesting.

			* Nerfed persistence trait (it was ticking much more often than intended)
			## [3.3.6] - 2019-08-13
			### Changed
			* Rebalanced chaos values for events. World chaos is once again added to player chaos, but with some exceptions. If player chaos is low and world chaos is high, the world chaos is replaced with the current equilibrium level. This should allow wisps to spawn rarely for players who are not producing chaos. Most events have too high of a minimum to trigger on the equilibrium level alone.
			### Fixed
			* Chaos rune recipes not producing valid runes
			* Empty pedestals absorbing chaos
			* Crash when placing soul urns in place of tall grass
			## [3.3.5] - 2019-08-12
			### Added
			* Cooldown timers to chaos events. Varies by event, from around 30 seconds to 20 minutes. Once an event is triggered for a player, the same event cannot trigger again until the cooldown expires. These timers are not stored in NBT, so they will reset when the game/server is restarted.
			* Some return home charm config options
			* Option to restrict to teleporters of the same gem (disabled by default)
			* Option to allow binding to anchors (enabled by default)
			* Option to set max uses (0/unlimited by default)
			* Amazonite gear part (Slurpie's Dongles)
			### Changed
			* Rebalanced some chaos-related stuff again
			* Wisps should be less common (min chaos 200k)
			* Corrupted blocks should be slightly more common (min chaos 750k)
			* Events are now rolled every second (up from every 5), makes cooldown times more sensible
			* Reduced chance of fire/lightning wisp shots lighting blocks on fires
			### Fixed
			* World chaos affecting chaos events for all players
			## [3.3.4] - 2019-08-11
			### Fixed
			* Crash when breaking soul urns [#391]
			## [3.3.3] - 2019-08-11
			### Added
			* Recipe for perfect chaos orb (may still change, feedback would be appreciated)
			* Recipes for most vacuum and planter soul urn upgrades
			* Planter soul urn upgrade model/texture, name [#386]
			* Thunderstorm chaos event (very low probability, minimum 1 million chaos)
			### Changed
			* Wisp colors now match their element
			* Increased odds of wisps spawning
			* Improved token enchanter's ingredient detection. It can now merge item stacks together if needed.
			### Fixed
			* Soul urns losing the "lidless" property when harvested
			* Lidless soul urn items not rendering correctly
			* Supercharger processing items that are already supercharged
			* HWYLA reporting the names of gem blocks incorrectly [#390]
			* Wisps trying to spawn on peaceful difficulty
			## [3.3.2] - 2019-08-06
			### Changed
			* Non-vanilla dimensions will now spawn classic gems in a "regional" style (similar to the Nether and The End).
			### Fixed
			* Recipe book crash on Forge 28.0.28+ [#385]
			* Supercharging in JEI showing items transforming into other items
			## [3.3.1] - 2019-07-28
			* Updated for Silent Gear 1.3.2
			## [3.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			### Added
			* A new set of hostile mobs, wisps. These will occasionally spawn on the surface near the player, depending on chaos levels. There are a few different types, each firing a projectile with a different effect.
			* Chaos meter item. Measures player and world chaos levels, sneak + right-click to change modes.
			* Config to override the "base biome seed", which will change which biomes gems will spawn in.
			* Tags for corruptable stone/dirt
			* Missing textures and models for corrupted piles and corrupting/purifying powder
			* Corrupting/purifying powder to some chest loot tables
			### Changed
			* Log biomes for gems in a more compact more, should appear in latest.log
			* Default soul urn capacity is now 54 (6 rows), upgrade has no effect right now
			* Sol and Luna traits now deal much more bonus damage, but with only a 25% chance of activating. Added knockback to sol/luna procs.
			### Fixed
			* Secret donuts kicking players from servers [#381]
			## [3.2.2] - 2019-07-05
			### Changed
			* Soul gem drop rates receive a small bonus from looting
			* Fluffy puffs and fluffy puff seeds can be placed in the composter
			### Fixed
			* Soul gems not having their data on the client when playing on a server [#380]
			* Soul gem drops crashing the game in some cases [#380]
			* Hardened stone generating over the ocean [#379]
			* Information on chaos buffs (runes for chaos gems) is now synced with the client
			## [3.2.1] - 2019-07-03
			### Fixed
			* Token enchanter recipes preventing server connection [#378]
			* JEI plugin failing to load on servers
			## [3.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Update to Minecraft 1.14.3
			### Added
			* Gems added to some loot tables
			### Fixed
			* Teleporters and return home charms not working
			## [3.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* Treasure Bags support (adds bags for gem sets, no way to obtain aside from commands yet)
			* A new command, `sg_soul`. Can currently be used to give soul gems or get a list of all registered souls.
			### Changed
			* Token enchanter recipes now use the vanilla recipe system, so they have moved to the recipes folder. `type` is `silentgems:token_enchanting`, the format is the same otherwise.
			* Updated gem shard textures
			### Fixed
			* Soul gem ingredient not working correctly
			## [3.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			(would have been 3.1.1, Git had other plans)
			Minimum Silent Gear version: 1.1.2
			### Added
			* Gem geodes are back. These are deposits of gems that are encased in hardened rock. There are classic, dark, and light variants, all found in the overworld.
			* Gem ores in the Nether and The End now spawn in "regions", similar to old optional configs. Each region will have 2-4 types of gems.
			* Dark and light glowroses now spawn in the Nether and The End, respectively
			* Implemented traits (some traits are still missing effects)
			* Chaotic - generates chaos when used
			* Entropy - increases block breaking speed depending on chaos levels
			* Luna - attacks deal more damage at night (cancels with Sol)
			* Persistence - slow self-repair
			* Runic - adds damage based on magic damage stat (this will change later)
			* Sol - attacks deal more damage during the day (cancels with Luna)
			### Changed
			* Updated dark gem ores to match new netherrack texture
			* Hardened stone, netherrack, and end stone textures
			* Gear souls no longer gain the armor trait unless on an armor item
			### Fixed
			* Requirements on some advancements (pedestals, hardened rock) [#373]
			* Undyed soul urn recipe not considering gem used
			## [3.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for ender slime spawns are back
			* Recipe advancements for most items (except gem stuff)
			## [3.0.12] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* Silver
			* Corrupting powder and purifying powder. These will create corrupted blocks, or restore them to their normal state. Recipes subject to change.
			### Changed
			* World chaos will now balance at a certain level, instead of zero. The level fluctuates over time.
			* Wild fluffy puff plants will only drop seeds now
			### Fixed
			* Possible fix for [#366]
			* Crash when Silent Gear not installed [#365]
			* Server crash
			## [3.0.11] - 2019-04-14
			### Added
			* Granite, diorite, andesite, and obsidian pedestals. Obsidian pedestal is black-resistant.
			* Chaos gems placed on pedestals will apply effects to nearby players, if enabled. The chaos produced is reduced slightly when applied to multiple players. Chaos gems can be enabled/disabled with redstone.
			* JEI plugin is back
			* Supercharger JEI support, also shows the blocks required for different pillar tiers
			* Token enchanter JEI support
			* Couple of advancements for pedestals
			* (API) IPedestalItem, allows items to be ticked when placed on pedestals
			### Removed
			* Unneeded block items (blocks you would normally never see in your inventory)
			### Changed
			* Pedestals can now accept a redstone signal to control some items.
			* Rebalanced chaos buff costs
			* Add leakage rate to chaos orb tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Pedestals not showing items on world load. Currently fixing this by just sending an update packet occasionally, so you may need to wait a few seconds.
			* Various localization errors
			## [3.0.10] - 2019-04-12
			Add some traits to some gems (still working on this). Many of the new traits do nothing right now.
			### Added
			* Chaos orbs are back. They absorb chaos, but efficiency varies. All orbs have a certain amount of "leakage". They can absorb a fixed amount of chaos, then they break.
			* Pedestals. Currently just a plain stone variety, will likely add more. Right-click to place/remove an item. Holds one item only.
			* Chaos orbs placed on pedestals will absorb chaos produced by nearby blocks
			* Config file (finally)
			### Changed
			* Glowroses spawn in sparser patches (you can tweak this in the config file). You can get the old behavior by setting `glowrose.world.placeTryCount` to 64 and maybe increase `glowrose.world.maxPerPatch`
			* Soul gem average drop rate reduced to 2.5% (from 3.5%). You can change this in the config file.
			## [3.0.9] - 2019-03-21
			### Added
			* Gear souls (formerly tool souls) are back! These work with Silent Gear items only. Soul skills are now learnable traits. Currently no way to customize the skill list, but it will likely happen. This means ANY trait could be made learnable, even user-defined traits.
			* New potion effects, grounded and insulated. These protect from the shocking and freezing effects (caused by the lightning/ice aspect enchantments). No way to get these effects yet.
			### Fixed
			* A server crash (EntityPlayerSP in ChaosGem)
			* Crash when Silent Gear is not loaded
			* Fluffy puffs not growing [#360]
			* Life Steal, Lightning Aspect, and Ice Aspect not working (Gravity still seems off)
			## [3.0.8] - 2019-03-16
			### Added
			* Chaos gems and chaos runes are back. Both are crafted in the token enchanter.
			* More advancements (supercharger pillar tiers, teleporters, and more)
			* Teleporter linker recipe
			* Ender slime spawns (plus spawn egg)
			### Changed
			* Enriched chaos crystals are now crafted in the token enchanter (same ingredients)
			* Reorganized some advancements
			### Fixed
			* "Modify soul urn" recipe is working again. Craft a soul urn with a gem or dyes to change its appearance. Dyeing working just like leather armor.
			* Chaos dust is now craftable (and therefore chaos iron)
			* Ender slime loot table
			## [3.0.7] - 2019-03-12
			### Fixed
			* Crash related to soul gems
			## [3.0.6] - 2019-03-12
			### Added
			* Teleporters are back.
			* Return home charms are back. Each gem variant is now a separate item.
			* Soul gems are back, with changes. A soul gem is automatically added for all living entities. Plant soul gems are gone. Elements are randomized and they will probably have nonsense names (TBD). The elements are meaningless until gear souls are added.
			* Soul gem ingredient for use in recipes. This allows vanilla shaped/shapeless recipes and token enchanter recipes to require a soul gem of a specific entity. See the wiki for details if you want to take advantage of this ~~(politely yell at me on Discord if I have forgotten to write the wiki page)~~.
			* You can now create spawn eggs in the token enchanter. Requires eggs, soul gems, and enriched chaos crystals (you can view the recipes in REI)
			* `sg_chaos` command can now target the world
			### Fixed
			* Ornate gold and silver rods crashing the game
			* `sg_chaos get` command now works correctly
			## [3.0.5] - 2019-03-09
			### Added
			* New chaos system. This is no longer an energy system, but more like a "pollution" system. Certain blocks and items (token enchanter, supercharger) will generate chaos. Chaos will dissipate naturally over time. Currently, there is no way to increase the dissipation rate. If chaos gets too high, you may see random lightning strikes or discover patches of corrupted stone or dirt underground. More effects are planned.
			* Token enchanter. This is the new way of creating enchantment tokens. It supports loading recipes from data packs (place the files in `data/*/silentgems/token_recipes`, where `*` is your data pack's namespace). These recipes are not limited to enchantment tokens, you could use it to create anything.
			* Partial REI support for token enchanter and supercharger. Speed crafting (shift-click to transfer ingredients) is _not_ supported at this time.
			* Wild fluffy puff plants to provide a source of seeds. Can be found in most (not all) biomes that get rain.
			* All foods have their respective effects again (try the donuts!)
			### Fixed
			* Gems missing rarity stat (Silent Gear) [#358]
			* Foods will return items again (sticks, bowls)
			## [3.0.4] - 2019-03-02
			### Added
			* Supercharger is back, along with full Silent Gear integration
			* Fluffy blocks are back
			* Advancements are back
			* Color handlers are back. Wrapped in a try-catch to (hopefully) prevent crashes.
			* Lots of missing recipes
			### Changed
			* Overhauled the localization file, minimizing duplication. Should make translating the mod easier.
			### Fixed
			* Soul urns should be fully functional (but cannot be crafted in survival due to lack of soul gem drops)
			* Ender crystal block effect was missing
			* Chaos coal blocks not working as fuel
			* Broken translations
			## [3.0.3] - 2019-02-24
			### Added
			* Null check for BlockColors and ItemColors. For some reason, these turn up null at random. This should prevent the crash when it happens but certain blocks or items may be missing their colors.
			## [3.0.2] - 2019-02-23
			### Added
			* Glowroses can now be planted in vanilla flower pots. This amplifies their light level to 15.
			* Chaos and Ender ore generation
			### Fixed
			* Nether and End gems not spawning. Currently, both will spawn multi-gem ore. The overworld still has biome-dependent spawns.
			* Glowrose hit box and collision fixed
			* Silent Gear part files corrected. These should function correctly whenever Gear is ready to release.
			## [3.0.1] - 2019-02-21
			### Fixed
			* Crash caused by a build error [#354]
			## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-21
			Ported to 1.13.2. This version will bring some major changes:
			* The Flattening has changed almost every block and item ID. Old worlds are not compatible.
			* Tools and armor have been removed.
			* For a similar system, check out Silent Gear.
			* I am considering a mod which will add simple, non-upgradeable gem tools.
			* The chaos system is gone, for now. I am working on an alternative. Chaos was never intended to be an energy system and I hope to make it into something more interesting.

			* Advancement translations (thanks xMGZx) [#31, #17]
			* Drying racks occasionally emit smoke particles when working
			### Changed
			* Wires are slightly more intelligent with their connections, reducing the amount of wrenching needed. Energy producing and storing blocks will default to an "in" connections, while machines will default to "out".

			* Canisters, stackable fluid containers (64 per slot). This will hold any fluid, but probably won't be recognized by other mods.
			* Fluid color is currently pulled from some JEI code until I write my own solution. If you report colorless fluids in canisters I will make fun of you :p
			* Pump, picks up fluids from the world. Can fill buckets or canisters. Requires some FE to work
			* Refinery is working
			* Refinery can fill buckets or fluid canisters
			* Temporary refinery textures
			* Plastic pellets and sheets (not craftable yet, we're getting there...)
			## [0.6.0] - 2019-09-23

			* Diesel, will be one product of refining oil. Currently no way to produce it.
			* Refinery, not functional. Will refine oil into other fluids. Has a "recipe" system which will allow mods or datapacks to use it.
			### Changed
			* Coal generator now also accepts `forge:nuggets/coal` [#18]
			### Fixed
			* Ores generating in wrong generation stage [#19]
			* Add loot table for basic crusher

			## [0.5.0] - 2019-08-30
			Updated for Forge 28.0.74+
			### Added
			* Lava Generator. Creates Forge Energy from lava (anything in the `minecraft:lava` fluid tag). Should interact with fluid pipes from other mods (not tested yet), or you can place lava buckets into its input slot.
			* Yes, the model is broken and the textures are temporary!
			* Currently generates 500K FE per lava bucket (feedback appreciated)
			* Steel recipe [#9]
			* ComputerCraft (CC Tweaked) computers can now read energy levels of machines and generators
			### Changed
			* Generators can now be controlled by redstone like machines (defaults to ignore redstone)
			* Coal generator now accepts only coal and charcoal (`minecraft:coals`) and coal blocks (`forge:storage_blocks/coal`) by default. Override the `silents_mechanisms:coal_generator_fuels` item tag if you need to change this.
			## [0.4.2] - 2019-08-24
			### Added
			* Machines can now be controlled by redstone (defaults to ignore redstone). Does not work on generators yet, expect it next update.
			* Machine frames (no use yet), Electrum
			### Changed
			* Machines are now set to their inactive state (and lose progress) when they run out of power
			### Fixed
			* Alloy smelter matching the wrong recipes
			## [0.4.1] - 2019-08-23
			### Added
			* Wrench item. Rotates some blocks and sets the connection type of wires
			* Wires are now implemented. They still require some work, but are usable.

			### Fixed
			* Blocks losing their inventory when broken [#4]
			## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-22
			* Big thanks to EnbyChu for making all the textures for this update!

			### Added
			* JEI support for drying rack
			### Changed
			* Tweaked display of some recipes in JEI (cut empty space on crusher category, fix clipping on compressor category)
			## [0.3.0] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Added
			* Drying racks. These have their own recipes, so mods or data packs can add recipes.

			* Recipe for alloy smelter
			* JEI support for alloy smelter
			* Some missing models, textures, and localized names

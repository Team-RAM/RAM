		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.3.0-33.jar:
			1.3.0-33 (12 Jun 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Logistics Core recipe has been changed to create two cores instead of one
			* Some drone pathfinding optimisation, in particular reducing server-side CPU usage when drones can't find a path
			* - Added some checks to cull a lot of unnecessary pathing searches
			* Small visual improvement for the Omnidirection & Liquid Hopppers
			* - Output spout is slightly narrower, and the output end is a little darker
			* Pastebin GUI: added "Pretty?" option to control pretty-printing of JSON output to Pastebin/clipboard
			* - Default is now not to pretty-print JSON, so saved drone programs & remote layouts are a lot more compact
			* Redstone Module I/O direction can now be configured in the module's GUI
			* - This does not require an Advanced PCB to be installed
			* - Toggling I/O with a Wrench still works too, as it used to
			* Drones (both entity and item form) now show their carried fluid, if any
			* - Shown in item tooltip for drones in item form
			* - Shown in TOP/Waila display for drone entities
			* It's now possible to attach levers/buttons/etc. to the side of camouflaged blocks (assuming the camouflage is solid, of course)
			* - This is particularly nice for camouflaged Pressure Tubes with Redstone Modules
			* Elevators with Charging Upgrades installed will now only add air back if it's safe to do so (pressure < 4.9 bar)
			* Some Micromissiles improvements
			* - Micromissiles now do more damage on direct entity hit (explosion position was further from the target entity than it should have been)
			* - Micromissiles can now be "repaired" in an Anvil with TNT (1 TNT restores 25 missile shots)
			* - Micromissile smoke particles are a bit less dense now
			* - Reduced default cooldown time from 15 ticks to 10 ticks (still adjustable in config)
			* Some Sentry Turret improvements
			* - Default entity filter for newly placed Sentry Turrets is now @mob - avoids pain & suffering if players load the turret and forget to set a filter
			* - Fixed the entity filter string not showing in GUI the first time it's opened
			* - Better filter validation and error display in the GUI
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Fixed Charging Stations at 0 bar not being able to discharge pressure from items into the station
			* Drones should be able to place blocks much more reliably now
			* Fixed Drones (and other entities) sometimes getting badly confused while trying to path across or through some PneumaticCraft blocks
			* - Blocks were wrongly reporting themselves suitable for pathing through, when their hitbox actually didn't allow it
			* Fixed the clientside drama_splash config option not being properly honoured when set to false
			* Some Programmer GUI fixes:
			* - Fixed widget area dragging behaviour when dragging items from inventory slots across it
			* - Fixed Area widgets in the programmer GUI not being sync'd to server when clicked with a GPS (or Area GPS) Tool
			* - Fixed Area widgets jumping position when clicked with a GPS or Area GPS tool in the programmer
			* - Fixed Pastebin communication (now using HTTPS exclusively, looks like HTTP is no longer accepted)
			* Fixed client crash caused by wrongly attempting to send some server->client sync packets
			* - Caused sometimes when breaking off camouflage blocks
			* Performance fix: Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers were causing some unnecessary block updates when their comparator output level changed
			* Fixed Omnidirectional Hopper comparator output being inaccurate under certain circumstances
			* All translation keys are now properly namespaced
			* - No player-visible change here but eliminates the risk of translation key clashes with other mods
			* Electrostatic Compressor item tooltip is much shorter now (long tooltip still visible in JEI and GUI side tab)

	Powder Power [FORGE] (PowderPower-1.15.2-3.1.65.jar --> PowderPower-1.15.2-3.1.66.jar):
		PowderPower-1.15.2-3.1.66.jar:
			New build with refreshed dependencies

	Quark (Quark-r2.1-240.jar --> Quark-r2.1-245.jar):
		Quark-r2.1-245.jar:
			* Added Endergetic Bolloon Bud to the piston blacklist since it wasn't compatible.
			* Extended the black screen a bit (til July 15th up from July 1st)
			* Fixed a crash when the language manager is missing.
			* Fixed crabs not dropping crab shells.
			* Fixed incorrect transparency on some pixels with bee skins.
			* Fixed sign edit breaking the sign button mod.
			* Fixed slime in a bucket being emptied if used in creative.
			* Fixed some blocks with particles not emitting particles when very far out into the world.
			* Made the q button rainbow during june

		Quark-r2.1-244.jar:
			Tweaked the black screen a bit:
			* The message will now only show up once per instance. It used to show up once per run, but I quickly realized that showing people the same message over and over isn't exactly going to lead to great results.
			* Tweaked the text a bit to be more factual.
			* Changed the order in which the message appears to help create less confusion. Previously the skip info would only show after a pause, which would make people confused.
			* Added a time killswitch, the message will automatically stop showing up for everyone after the 1st of July. This may be extended in future versions if need be, but this should be good for now.
			* If you're a modpack maker, and you do not want the message shipped, include /saves/.quark/.blm_marker in your files. I'd rather you didn't, but I also understand it's somewhat hypocritical to rail on mods with player banning code and not give pack makers an option here.

			Love your neighbor as yourself.

			# Changelog
			The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/]()),
			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).
			## [1.7.4] - 2020-06-13
			Requires Silent Lib 4.6.3
			### Added
			* Compound grip parts and grip blueprint
			* New material grader (only works with the new material system). Works like the part analyzer, but with some changes. [#83]
			* Catalysts are now **required**.
			* There are now five catalyst tier tags. Tier 1 has a median grade of C. Tiers 4 & 5 are empty by default.
			* Graded materials (less than SSS) can now be "re-rolled" by placing them back into the input slot. The grader will consume catalyst until a higher grade is rolled. If a lower grade is rolled, the item is unchanged and remains in the input slot.
			* Blaze gold, can be used for crafting with the new material system
			* Blazing dust, tier 2 grader catalyst
			### Changed
			* Grade bonus percentages - no more negative values, but the top grades have had there bonuses reduced since they apply to non-main parts now.
			* Glittery dust is now a tier 3 grader catalyst
			* Materials dump command (`/sgear_mats dump`)
			* Clicking the file name in chat will open the generated file
			* Sorted entries by part type then material ID
			### Fixed
			* Crash with `ShapelessCompoundPartRecipe` and `MaterialInstance` [#135]
			* Compound rods being craftable with non-rod materials
			## [1.7.3] - 2020-06-10
			* Requires Silent Lib 4.6.2
			* 'b' build updates mods.toml to contain correct Silent Lib version
			* 'c' build fixes a crash in `ExclusionIngredient`
			### Added
			* Slingshots (finally). Faster to draw but weaker than bows. Uses pebbles for ammo. Ammo cannot be retrieved.
			* Synergy traits. This allows the existing Synergistic and Crude traits to be customized, as well as allowing new synergy traits to be added.
			* Rustic trait. Increases synergy, but only if the base value is between 75% and 100%.
			* Compound rods are technically craftable and usable in this build. Not thoroughly tested yet! The recipe does not show in JEI. It's a rod blueprint and two materials.
			* Note this uses the new material system! Any main parts previously added by data packs will not work.
			### Changed
			* Some changes to how colors are handled. All layer colors are now cached in NBT. Locked and unlocked gear should update.
			* Gear items will now exclude some stats from their NBT, such as armor stats on tools. This should have no impact on how the mod plays.
			* Debug log will now contain detailed information on stat recalculations (forced on for now)
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method to return an `IItemColor`, which will be automatically registered. This defaults to the appropriate method for most items.
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method called `getExcludedStats`. Stats returned here will not be calculated or stored in NBT. The default implementations should be suitable for most items.
			## [1.7.2] - 2020-06-05
			Requires Forge 31.2.5 or higher
			### Added
			* Moar new traits!
			* Cursed - Reduces luck. Cancels with Lucky. Max level 7, same as Lucky.
			* Magnetic - Pulls in nearby items, range based on level
			* Terminus - Creates and places stone blocks, costs 1 durability per use
			* A couple of secret traits of questionable usefulness...
			* Shears (NOTE: these do not function correctly because of missing Forge patches!) [#103]
			* `/sgear_mats` command for interacting with new WIP material system (currently unused)
			### Changed
			* The `silentgear:refractive` trait type has been replaced with `silentgear:block_placer`, which can be made to place any block!
			### Fixed
			* Flammable's item destroyed message not giving the item name
			* Shields not being enchantable
			## [1.7.1] - 2020-05-29
			### Added
			* Flammable trait (only on wood by default). Flammable items take damage if the player is on fire and the item is equipped. They can also be used as fuel in furnaces, with the burn time being proportional to the item's durability.
			### Fixed
			* Attribute traits (Lucky) stacking each time item is equipped [#129]
			* Parts GUI not displaying stats correctly [#128]
			## [1.7.0] - 2020-05-20
			### Added
			* Command to export part data to a TSV file, `/sgear_parts dump`. A TSV file can be imported into any spreadsheet program.
			* Spoon trait. This allows any part to function like a spoon upgrade. It will only work on pickaxes, same as before.
			* Crushing trait. Increases armor and decreases attack damage as gear is damaged.
			* ru_ru.json lang file (vanja-san) [#118]
			### Changed
			* Reworked some gear tooltip stuff. Synergy is under stats. Traits are more clearly labeled.
			* (API) - Stats are now a Forge registry and should be registered using the Register event.
			* Stat names with the `silentgear` namespace can continue to omit the namespace in JSON files, others should include it.
			* The stat multiplier config settings are currently broken
			### Fixed
			* Balanced armor and shield repairs (now based on armor durability stat) [#123]
			* Blueprint paper recipe not accepting tagged dyes [#122]
			* Duplication of upgrade parts in some cases [#121]
			* `silentgear:has_part` and `silentgear:has_trait` loot conditions not working for weapons
			## [1.6.4] - 2020-05-13
			### Added
			* Indestructible trait, prevents durability loss (not found on any default part for now, but the trait does work)
			* Lucky trait, increases luck when in main or off hand
			### Changed
			* Refractive trait now places phantom lights on right-click at the cost of 5 durability [#105]
			* Phantom lights now generate particles
			* Broken armor no longer renders on the player
			* Prettified stat tooltips on gear items (with colors!)
			* (API) Traits can now modify the right-click action of tools
			### Fixed
			* Ranged speed stat not working on bows [#119]
			* Bows and crossbows displaying "When in main hand" with no modifiers
			## [1.6.3] - 2020-05-07
			### Changed
			* Shield durability is now based on the "armor durability" stat. Iron shields should be the same durability as vanilla shields.
			* Reworked the way stat modifiers are read from part JSONs. Old files are still compatible. New style is less verbose.
			### Fixed
			* Shield models in wrong location (Partonetrain) [#117]
			* Shields not having any color [#114]
			* Netherwood sticks will no longer lower durability below 20
			* Multiple modifiers on a single stat for a part not working
			## [1.6.2] - 2020-05-02
			### Fixed
			* Possible crash with armor and Quark [#115]
			* Possible solution for CME in PartManager [#104]
			* "Add harvest level" stat modifiers not working (ornate gold rod from SGems). This moves the "max" operation to right after the "avg" operation. Shouldn't effect stat calculations in most other cases. [#70]
			* Armor showing "When in main hand" in tooltip
			## [1.6.1] - 2020-04-27
			### Added
			* Paxels are back! Requires 5 mains and a rod. Small durability bonus, small penalty to harvest speed and enchantability. [#114]
			* Shields are here (technically). Model currently has issues and colors do not work. Not sure how to fix this just yet. [#114]
			### Fixed
			* Netherwood trees not spawning [#110]
			* A possible lumber axe crash when used on large trees [#84]
			* (API) `PartData.onAddedToGear` being called too often [[Super Multi-Drills #19]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19))]
			## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-20
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart.randomizeData`, creates a PartData object used during random gear generation
			### Changed
			* Move all gear crafting recipes to their own tab in JEI [#106]
			* (API) PartTypes can now specify a fallback part, deprecates `PartManager.tryGetFallback`
			* (API) Gear class maps in ModItems now use ResourceLocations for keys, to allow other mods to add gear types
			### Fixed
			* Swapping gear parts will now attempt to return the replaced parts in the crafting grid
			* Part names being underlined after viewing them in the parts menu
			* Gear randomizer not selecting parts in some cases
			* Random gear command not working with command blocks
			* Salvager attaching grade NBT to returned items
			## [1.5.8] - 2020-04-15
			### Fixed
			* Server crash caused by new command added in 1.5.7 [#112]
			* Issues with armor coloring being incorrect, adds a couple new texture properties to part JSONs (see [Silent's Gems #454]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454)))
			* `armor_color` - The color of the armor model (defaults to `fallback_color`)
			* `armor_texture` - The prefix of the armor texture path (defaults to `texture_suffix`)
			* You can leave these new properties out (default) in most cases
			* This fix disables color blending for armor models (items will still show blending)
			## [1.5.7] - 2020-04-12
			Requires Forge 31.1.18 or higher
			### Added
			* Command to show parts GUI (`/sgear_parts show_gui`). Does not require OP perms. [#107]
			* Crimson iron and steel blocks [#88]
			* Golden nether banana [#88]
			### Changed
			* Updated compatible items to remove from drop system of Mine and Slash (AzureDoom) [#97]
			* `/sgear_parts list` no longer requires OP perms
			### Fixed
			* Magmatic trait not working [#109]
			## [1.5.6] - 2020-04-07
			### Added
			* Attribute modifier traits. These will apply attribute modifiers to gear items based on the type of gear and the trait level.
			### Changed
			* (API) Replace Lombok getters with normal getters. API unchanged, just makes the code clearer.

			* Crimson iron dust and ore chunks are no longer hidden when Silent's Mechanisms is not installed [#87]
			* Cutout blocks (flax, stone torch) rendering incorrectly [#86]
			* Version in crafting station screen showing 1.14.4 instead of actual Minecraft version [#85]
			## [1.5.0] - 2020-02-01
			Ported to Minecraft 1.15.2
			### Added
			* Login message to warn the player when parts and traits fail to load. Instructs the player on what to search for in their log file ("Failed to reload data packs").
			### Removed

			### Fixed
			* Hidden parts appearing on the parts screen in the crafting station
			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19

			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

		SilentGear-1.15.2-1.7.3c+101.jar:
			# Changelog
			The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/]()),
			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).
			## [1.7.3] - 2020-06-10
			* Requires Silent Lib 4.6.2
			* 'b' build updates mods.toml to contain correct Silent Lib version
			* 'c' build fixes a crash in `ExclusionIngredient`
			### Added
			* Slingshots (finally). Faster to draw but weaker than bows. Uses pebbles for ammo. Ammo cannot be retrieved.
			* Synergy traits. This allows the existing Synergistic and Crude traits to be customized, as well as allowing new synergy traits to be added.
			* Rustic trait. Increases synergy, but only if the base value is between 75% and 100%.
			* Compound rods are technically craftable and usable in this build. Not thoroughly tested yet! The recipe does not show in JEI. It's a rod blueprint and two materials.
			* Note this uses the new material system! Any main parts previously added by data packs will not work.
			### Changed
			* Some changes to how colors are handled. All layer colors are now cached in NBT. Locked and unlocked gear should update.
			* Gear items will now exclude some stats from their NBT, such as armor stats on tools. This should have no impact on how the mod plays.
			* Debug log will now contain detailed information on stat recalculations (forced on for now)
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method to return an `IItemColor`, which will be automatically registered. This defaults to the appropriate method for most items.
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method called `getExcludedStats`. Stats returned here will not be calculated or stored in NBT. The default implementations should be suitable for most items.
			## [1.7.2] - 2020-06-05
			Requires Forge 31.2.5 or higher
			### Added
			* Moar new traits!
			* Cursed - Reduces luck. Cancels with Lucky. Max level 7, same as Lucky.
			* Magnetic - Pulls in nearby items, range based on level
			* Terminus - Creates and places stone blocks, costs 1 durability per use
			* A couple of secret traits of questionable usefulness...
			* Shears (NOTE: these do not function correctly because of missing Forge patches!) [#103]
			* `/sgear_mats` command for interacting with new WIP material system (currently unused)
			### Changed
			* The `silentgear:refractive` trait type has been replaced with `silentgear:block_placer`, which can be made to place any block!
			### Fixed
			* Flammable's item destroyed message not giving the item name
			* Shields not being enchantable
			## [1.7.1] - 2020-05-29
			### Added
			* Flammable trait (only on wood by default). Flammable items take damage if the player is on fire and the item is equipped. They can also be used as fuel in furnaces, with the burn time being proportional to the item's durability.
			### Fixed
			* Attribute traits (Lucky) stacking each time item is equipped [#129]
			* Parts GUI not displaying stats correctly [#128]
			## [1.7.0] - 2020-05-20
			### Added
			* Command to export part data to a TSV file, `/sgear_parts dump`. A TSV file can be imported into any spreadsheet program.
			* Spoon trait. This allows any part to function like a spoon upgrade. It will only work on pickaxes, same as before.
			* Crushing trait. Increases armor and decreases attack damage as gear is damaged.
			* ru_ru.json lang file (vanja-san) [#118]
			### Changed
			* Reworked some gear tooltip stuff. Synergy is under stats. Traits are more clearly labeled.
			* (API) - Stats are now a Forge registry and should be registered using the Register event.
			* Stat names with the `silentgear` namespace can continue to omit the namespace in JSON files, others should include it.
			* The stat multiplier config settings are currently broken
			### Fixed
			* Balanced armor and shield repairs (now based on armor durability stat) [#123]
			* Blueprint paper recipe not accepting tagged dyes [#122]
			* Duplication of upgrade parts in some cases [#121]
			* `silentgear:has_part` and `silentgear:has_trait` loot conditions not working for weapons
			## [1.6.4] - 2020-05-13
			### Added
			* Indestructible trait, prevents durability loss (not found on any default part for now, but the trait does work)
			* Lucky trait, increases luck when in main or off hand
			### Changed
			* Refractive trait now places phantom lights on right-click at the cost of 5 durability [#105]
			* Phantom lights now generate particles
			* Broken armor no longer renders on the player
			* Prettified stat tooltips on gear items (with colors!)
			* (API) Traits can now modify the right-click action of tools
			### Fixed
			* Ranged speed stat not working on bows [#119]
			* Bows and crossbows displaying "When in main hand" with no modifiers
			## [1.6.3] - 2020-05-07
			### Changed
			* Shield durability is now based on the "armor durability" stat. Iron shields should be the same durability as vanilla shields.
			* Reworked the way stat modifiers are read from part JSONs. Old files are still compatible. New style is less verbose.
			### Fixed
			* Shield models in wrong location (Partonetrain) [#117]
			* Shields not having any color [#114]
			* Netherwood sticks will no longer lower durability below 20
			* Multiple modifiers on a single stat for a part not working
			## [1.6.2] - 2020-05-02
			### Fixed
			* Possible crash with armor and Quark [#115]
			* Possible solution for CME in PartManager [#104]
			* "Add harvest level" stat modifiers not working (ornate gold rod from SGems). This moves the "max" operation to right after the "avg" operation. Shouldn't effect stat calculations in most other cases. [#70]
			* Armor showing "When in main hand" in tooltip
			## [1.6.1] - 2020-04-27
			### Added
			* Paxels are back! Requires 5 mains and a rod. Small durability bonus, small penalty to harvest speed and enchantability. [#114]
			* Shields are here (technically). Model currently has issues and colors do not work. Not sure how to fix this just yet. [#114]
			### Fixed
			* Netherwood trees not spawning [#110]
			* A possible lumber axe crash when used on large trees [#84]
			* (API) `PartData.onAddedToGear` being called too often [[Super Multi-Drills #19]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19))]
			## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-20
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart.randomizeData`, creates a PartData object used during random gear generation
			### Changed
			* Move all gear crafting recipes to their own tab in JEI [#106]
			* (API) PartTypes can now specify a fallback part, deprecates `PartManager.tryGetFallback`
			* (API) Gear class maps in ModItems now use ResourceLocations for keys, to allow other mods to add gear types
			### Fixed
			* Swapping gear parts will now attempt to return the replaced parts in the crafting grid
			* Part names being underlined after viewing them in the parts menu
			* Gear randomizer not selecting parts in some cases
			* Random gear command not working with command blocks
			* Salvager attaching grade NBT to returned items
			## [1.5.8] - 2020-04-15
			### Fixed
			* Server crash caused by new command added in 1.5.7 [#112]
			* Issues with armor coloring being incorrect, adds a couple new texture properties to part JSONs (see [Silent's Gems #454]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454)))
			* `armor_color` - The color of the armor model (defaults to `fallback_color`)
			* `armor_texture` - The prefix of the armor texture path (defaults to `texture_suffix`)
			* You can leave these new properties out (default) in most cases
			* This fix disables color blending for armor models (items will still show blending)
			## [1.5.7] - 2020-04-12
			Requires Forge 31.1.18 or higher
			### Added
			* Command to show parts GUI (`/sgear_parts show_gui`). Does not require OP perms. [#107]
			* Crimson iron and steel blocks [#88]
			* Golden nether banana [#88]
			### Changed
			* Updated compatible items to remove from drop system of Mine and Slash (AzureDoom) [#97]
			* `/sgear_parts list` no longer requires OP perms
			### Fixed
			* Magmatic trait not working [#109]

			### Added
			* Attribute modifier traits. These will apply attribute modifiers to gear items based on the type of gear and the trait level.
			### Changed
			* (API) Replace Lombok getters with normal getters. API unchanged, just makes the code clearer.

			* Cutout blocks (flax, stone torch) rendering incorrectly [#86]
			* Version in crafting station screen showing 1.14.4 instead of actual Minecraft version [#85]
			## [1.5.0] - 2020-02-01
			Ported to Minecraft 1.15.2
			### Added
			* Login message to warn the player when parts and traits fail to load. Instructs the player on what to search for in their log file ("Failed to reload data packs").
			### Removed
			* The part analyzer and part grading. See issue [#83]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/83](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/83)) for plans/discussion.

			### Fixed
			* Upgrade parts applying to invalid gear items
			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed
			* Data paths for parts and traits changed. silentgear/parts is now silentgear_parts and silentgear/traits is now silentgear_traits. Files in the old location will still load for now.
			### Fixed
			* Hidden parts appearing on the parts screen in the crafting station
			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19
			### Added
			* Gear name prefixes. Can be added to individual parts (see rough rods for any example), or through an event (GearNamePrefixesEvent)
			### Changed
			* Mine and Slash random drops are now tier 1 minimum
			* Mine and Slash random drops should now be salvagable
			### Fixed
			* Hammer dupe [#51]
			* JEI failing to load on servers [#52]

			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added

			### Fixed
			* Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12

			* Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			* Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			* Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

		SilentGear-1.15.2-1.7.3b+100.jar:
			# Changelog
			The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/]()),
			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).
			## [1.7.3] - 2020-06-10
			* Requires Silent Lib 4.6.2
			* 'b' build updates mods.toml to contain correct Silent Lib version
			### Added
			* Slingshots (finally). Faster to draw but weaker than bows. Uses pebbles for ammo. Ammo cannot be retrieved.
			* Synergy traits. This allows the existing Synergistic and Crude traits to be customized, as well as allowing new synergy traits to be added.
			* Rustic trait. Increases synergy, but only if the base value is between 75% and 100%.
			* Compound rods are technically craftable and usable in this build. Not thoroughly tested yet! The recipe does not show in JEI. It's a rod blueprint and two materials.
			* Note this uses the new material system! Any main parts previously added by data packs will not work.
			### Changed
			* Some changes to how colors are handled. All layer colors are now cached in NBT. Locked and unlocked gear should update.
			* Gear items will now exclude some stats from their NBT, such as armor stats on tools. This should have no impact on how the mod plays.
			* Debug log will now contain detailed information on stat recalculations (forced on for now)
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method to return an `IItemColor`, which will be automatically registered. This defaults to the appropriate method for most items.
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method called `getExcludedStats`. Stats returned here will not be calculated or stored in NBT. The default implementations should be suitable for most items.
			## [1.7.2] - 2020-06-05
			Requires Forge 31.2.5 or higher
			### Added
			* Moar new traits!
			* Cursed - Reduces luck. Cancels with Lucky. Max level 7, same as Lucky.
			* Magnetic - Pulls in nearby items, range based on level
			* Terminus - Creates and places stone blocks, costs 1 durability per use
			* A couple of secret traits of questionable usefulness...
			* Shears (NOTE: these do not function correctly because of missing Forge patches!) [#103]
			* `/sgear_mats` command for interacting with new WIP material system (currently unused)
			### Changed
			* The `silentgear:refractive` trait type has been replaced with `silentgear:block_placer`, which can be made to place any block!
			### Fixed
			* Flammable's item destroyed message not giving the item name
			* Shields not being enchantable
			## [1.7.1] - 2020-05-29
			### Added
			* Flammable trait (only on wood by default). Flammable items take damage if the player is on fire and the item is equipped. They can also be used as fuel in furnaces, with the burn time being proportional to the item's durability.
			### Fixed
			* Attribute traits (Lucky) stacking each time item is equipped [#129]
			* Parts GUI not displaying stats correctly [#128]
			## [1.7.0] - 2020-05-20
			### Added
			* Command to export part data to a TSV file, `/sgear_parts dump`. A TSV file can be imported into any spreadsheet program.
			* Spoon trait. This allows any part to function like a spoon upgrade. It will only work on pickaxes, same as before.
			* Crushing trait. Increases armor and decreases attack damage as gear is damaged.
			* ru_ru.json lang file (vanja-san) [#118]
			### Changed
			* Reworked some gear tooltip stuff. Synergy is under stats. Traits are more clearly labeled.
			* (API) - Stats are now a Forge registry and should be registered using the Register event.
			* Stat names with the `silentgear` namespace can continue to omit the namespace in JSON files, others should include it.
			* The stat multiplier config settings are currently broken
			### Fixed
			* Balanced armor and shield repairs (now based on armor durability stat) [#123]
			* Blueprint paper recipe not accepting tagged dyes [#122]
			* Duplication of upgrade parts in some cases [#121]
			* `silentgear:has_part` and `silentgear:has_trait` loot conditions not working for weapons
			## [1.6.4] - 2020-05-13
			### Added
			* Indestructible trait, prevents durability loss (not found on any default part for now, but the trait does work)
			* Lucky trait, increases luck when in main or off hand
			### Changed
			* Refractive trait now places phantom lights on right-click at the cost of 5 durability [#105]
			* Phantom lights now generate particles
			* Broken armor no longer renders on the player
			* Prettified stat tooltips on gear items (with colors!)
			* (API) Traits can now modify the right-click action of tools
			### Fixed
			* Ranged speed stat not working on bows [#119]
			* Bows and crossbows displaying "When in main hand" with no modifiers
			## [1.6.3] - 2020-05-07
			### Changed
			* Shield durability is now based on the "armor durability" stat. Iron shields should be the same durability as vanilla shields.
			* Reworked the way stat modifiers are read from part JSONs. Old files are still compatible. New style is less verbose.
			### Fixed
			* Shield models in wrong location (Partonetrain) [#117]
			* Shields not having any color [#114]
			* Netherwood sticks will no longer lower durability below 20
			* Multiple modifiers on a single stat for a part not working
			## [1.6.2] - 2020-05-02
			### Fixed
			* Possible crash with armor and Quark [#115]
			* Possible solution for CME in PartManager [#104]
			* "Add harvest level" stat modifiers not working (ornate gold rod from SGems). This moves the "max" operation to right after the "avg" operation. Shouldn't effect stat calculations in most other cases. [#70]
			* Armor showing "When in main hand" in tooltip
			## [1.6.1] - 2020-04-27
			### Added
			* Paxels are back! Requires 5 mains and a rod. Small durability bonus, small penalty to harvest speed and enchantability. [#114]
			* Shields are here (technically). Model currently has issues and colors do not work. Not sure how to fix this just yet. [#114]
			### Fixed
			* Netherwood trees not spawning [#110]
			* A possible lumber axe crash when used on large trees [#84]
			* (API) `PartData.onAddedToGear` being called too often [[Super Multi-Drills #19]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19))]
			## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-20
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart.randomizeData`, creates a PartData object used during random gear generation
			### Changed
			* Move all gear crafting recipes to their own tab in JEI [#106]
			* (API) PartTypes can now specify a fallback part, deprecates `PartManager.tryGetFallback`
			* (API) Gear class maps in ModItems now use ResourceLocations for keys, to allow other mods to add gear types
			### Fixed
			* Swapping gear parts will now attempt to return the replaced parts in the crafting grid
			* Part names being underlined after viewing them in the parts menu
			* Gear randomizer not selecting parts in some cases
			* Random gear command not working with command blocks
			* Salvager attaching grade NBT to returned items
			## [1.5.8] - 2020-04-15
			### Fixed
			* Server crash caused by new command added in 1.5.7 [#112]
			* Issues with armor coloring being incorrect, adds a couple new texture properties to part JSONs (see [Silent's Gems #454]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454)))
			* `armor_color` - The color of the armor model (defaults to `fallback_color`)
			* `armor_texture` - The prefix of the armor texture path (defaults to `texture_suffix`)
			* You can leave these new properties out (default) in most cases
			* This fix disables color blending for armor models (items will still show blending)
			## [1.5.7] - 2020-04-12
			Requires Forge 31.1.18 or higher
			### Added
			* Command to show parts GUI (`/sgear_parts show_gui`). Does not require OP perms. [#107]
			* Crimson iron and steel blocks [#88]
			* Golden nether banana [#88]
			### Changed
			* Updated compatible items to remove from drop system of Mine and Slash (AzureDoom) [#97]
			* `/sgear_parts list` no longer requires OP perms
			### Fixed
			* Magmatic trait not working [#109]

			* Cutout blocks (flax, stone torch) rendering incorrectly [#86]
			* Version in crafting station screen showing 1.14.4 instead of actual Minecraft version [#85]
			## [1.5.0] - 2020-02-01
			Ported to Minecraft 1.15.2
			### Added
			* Login message to warn the player when parts and traits fail to load. Instructs the player on what to search for in their log file ("Failed to reload data packs").
			### Removed
			* The part analyzer and part grading. See issue [#83]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/83](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/83)) for plans/discussion.
			## [1.4.6] - 2019-12-25

			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			* Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			* Armor not using blended colors
			* Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19
			### Added
			* Gear name prefixes. Can be added to individual parts (see rough rods for any example), or through an event (GearNamePrefixesEvent)
			### Changed
			* Mine and Slash random drops are now tier 1 minimum
			* Mine and Slash random drops should now be salvagable
			### Fixed
			* Hammer dupe [#51]
			* JEI failing to load on servers [#52]
			* JEI complaining about QuickRepairRecipe
			## [1.3.8] - 2019-08-13
			### Fixed
			* Mine and Slash compatibility race condition
			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added
			* Basic compatibility for Mine and Slash
			### Fixed
			* Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12
			### Added
			* Stat multiplier configs for gear. These allow the stat values of all items to be increased or decreased without overwriting every part file.
			* Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			* Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			* Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/&lt;namespace&gt;/silentgear/parts/`, where `&lt;namespace&gt;` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

		SilentGear-1.15.2-1.7.3+99.jar:
			# Changelog
			The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/]()),
			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).
			## [1.7.3] - 2020-06-10
			Requires Silent Lib 4.6.2
			### Added
			* Slingshots (finally). Faster to draw but weaker than bows. Uses pebbles for ammo. Ammo cannot be retrieved.
			* Synergy traits. This allows the existing Synergistic and Crude traits to be customized, as well as allowing new synergy traits to be added.
			* Rustic trait. Increases synergy, but only if the base value is between 75% and 100%.
			* Compound rods are technically craftable and usable in this build. Not thoroughly tested yet! The recipe does not show in JEI. It's a rod blueprint and two materials.
			* Note this uses the new material system! Any main parts previously added by data packs will not work.
			### Changed
			* Some changes to how colors are handled. All layer colors are now cached in NBT. Locked and unlocked gear should update.
			* Gear items will now exclude some stats from their NBT, such as armor stats on tools. This should have no impact on how the mod plays.
			* Debug log will now contain detailed information on stat recalculations (forced on for now)
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method to return an `IItemColor`, which will be automatically registered. This defaults to the appropriate method for most items.
			* (API) `ICoreItem` now has a method called `getExcludedStats`. Stats returned here will not be calculated or stored in NBT. The default implementations should be suitable for most items.
			## [1.7.2] - 2020-06-05
			### Added
			* Moar new traits!
			* Cursed - Reduces luck. Cancels with Lucky. Max level 7, same as Lucky.
			* Magnetic - Pulls in nearby items, range based on level
			* Terminus - Creates and places stone blocks, costs 1 durability per use
			* A couple of secret traits of questionable usefulness...
			* Shears (NOTE: these do not function correctly because of missing Forge patches!) [#103]
			* `/sgear_mats` command for interacting with new WIP material system (currently unused)
			### Changed
			* The `silentgear:refractive` trait type has been replaced with `silentgear:block_placer`, which can be made to place any block!
			### Fixed
			* Flammable's item destroyed message not giving the item name
			* Shields not being enchantable
			## [1.7.1] - 2020-05-29
			### Added
			* Flammable trait (only on wood by default). Flammable items take damage if the player is on fire and the item is equipped. They can also be used as fuel in furnaces, with the burn time being proportional to the item's durability.
			### Fixed
			* Attribute traits (Lucky) stacking each time item is equipped [#129]
			* Parts GUI not displaying stats correctly [#128]
			## [1.7.0] - 2020-05-20
			### Added
			* Command to export part data to a TSV file, `/sgear_parts dump`. A TSV file can be imported into any spreadsheet program.
			* Spoon trait. This allows any part to function like a spoon upgrade. It will only work on pickaxes, same as before.
			* Crushing trait. Increases armor and decreases attack damage as gear is damaged.
			* ru_ru.json lang file (vanja-san) [#118]
			### Changed
			* Reworked some gear tooltip stuff. Synergy is under stats. Traits are more clearly labeled.
			* (API) - Stats are now a Forge registry and should be registered using the Register event.
			* Stat names with the `silentgear` namespace can continue to omit the namespace in JSON files, others should include it.
			* The stat multiplier config settings are currently broken
			### Fixed
			* Balanced armor and shield repairs (now based on armor durability stat) [#123]
			* Blueprint paper recipe not accepting tagged dyes [#122]
			* Duplication of upgrade parts in some cases [#121]
			* `silentgear:has_part` and `silentgear:has_trait` loot conditions not working for weapons
			## [1.6.4] - 2020-05-13
			### Added
			* Indestructible trait, prevents durability loss (not found on any default part for now, but the trait does work)
			* Lucky trait, increases luck when in main or off hand
			### Changed
			* Refractive trait now places phantom lights on right-click at the cost of 5 durability [#105]
			* Phantom lights now generate particles
			* Broken armor no longer renders on the player
			* Prettified stat tooltips on gear items (with colors!)
			* (API) Traits can now modify the right-click action of tools
			### Fixed
			* Ranged speed stat not working on bows [#119]
			* Bows and crossbows displaying "When in main hand" with no modifiers
			## [1.6.3] - 2020-05-07
			### Changed
			* Shield durability is now based on the "armor durability" stat. Iron shields should be the same durability as vanilla shields.
			* Reworked the way stat modifiers are read from part JSONs. Old files are still compatible. New style is less verbose.
			### Fixed
			* Shield models in wrong location (Partonetrain) [#117]
			* Shields not having any color [#114]
			* Netherwood sticks will no longer lower durability below 20
			* Multiple modifiers on a single stat for a part not working
			## [1.6.2] - 2020-05-02
			### Fixed
			* Possible crash with armor and Quark [#115]
			* Possible solution for CME in PartManager [#104]
			* "Add harvest level" stat modifiers not working (ornate gold rod from SGems). This moves the "max" operation to right after the "avg" operation. Shouldn't effect stat calculations in most other cases. [#70]
			* Armor showing "When in main hand" in tooltip
			## [1.6.1] - 2020-04-27
			### Added
			* Paxels are back! Requires 5 mains and a rod. Small durability bonus, small penalty to harvest speed and enchantability. [#114]
			* Shields are here (technically). Model currently has issues and colors do not work. Not sure how to fix this just yet. [#114]
			### Fixed
			* Netherwood trees not spawning [#110]
			* A possible lumber axe crash when used on large trees [#84]
			* (API) `PartData.onAddedToGear` being called too often [[Super Multi-Drills #19]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19))]
			## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-20
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart.randomizeData`, creates a PartData object used during random gear generation
			### Changed
			* Move all gear crafting recipes to their own tab in JEI [#106]
			* (API) PartTypes can now specify a fallback part, deprecates `PartManager.tryGetFallback`
			* (API) Gear class maps in ModItems now use ResourceLocations for keys, to allow other mods to add gear types
			### Fixed
			* Swapping gear parts will now attempt to return the replaced parts in the crafting grid
			* Part names being underlined after viewing them in the parts menu
			* Gear randomizer not selecting parts in some cases
			* Random gear command not working with command blocks
			* Salvager attaching grade NBT to returned items
			## [1.5.8] - 2020-04-15
			### Fixed
			* Server crash caused by new command added in 1.5.7 [#112]
			* Issues with armor coloring being incorrect, adds a couple new texture properties to part JSONs (see [Silent's Gems #454]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454)))
			* `armor_color` - The color of the armor model (defaults to `fallback_color`)
			* `armor_texture` - The prefix of the armor texture path (defaults to `texture_suffix`)
			* You can leave these new properties out (default) in most cases
			* This fix disables color blending for armor models (items will still show blending)
			## [1.5.7] - 2020-04-12
			Requires Forge 31.1.18 or higher
			### Added
			* Command to show parts GUI (`/sgear_parts show_gui`). Does not require OP perms. [#107]
			* Crimson iron and steel blocks [#88]
			* Golden nether banana [#88]
			### Changed
			* Updated compatible items to remove from drop system of Mine and Slash (AzureDoom) [#97]
			* `/sgear_parts list` no longer requires OP perms
			### Fixed
			* Magmatic trait not working [#109]
			## [1.5.6] - 2020-04-07
			### Added
			* Attribute modifier traits. These will apply attribute modifiers to gear items based on the type of gear and the trait level.
			### Changed
			* (API) Replace Lombok getters with normal getters. API unchanged, just makes the code clearer.
			## [1.5.5] - 2020-04-03

			* Cutout blocks (flax, stone torch) rendering incorrectly [#86]
			* Version in crafting station screen showing 1.14.4 instead of actual Minecraft version [#85]
			## [1.5.0] - 2020-02-01
			Ported to Minecraft 1.15.2
			### Added
			* Login message to warn the player when parts and traits fail to load. Instructs the player on what to search for in their log file ("Failed to reload data packs").
			### Removed
			* The part analyzer and part grading. See issue [#83]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/83](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/83)) for plans/discussion.
			## [1.4.6] - 2019-12-25

			## [1.4.2] - 2019-09-29
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart#onGearDamaged`

			### Fixed
			* Upgrade parts applying to invalid gear items
			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed

			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier

			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added
			* Basic compatibility for Mine and Slash
			### Fixed
			* Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12
			### Added
			* Stat multiplier configs for gear. These allow the stat values of all items to be increased or decreased without overwriting every part file.
			* Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			* Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			* Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			* A couple more advancements
			* Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			* Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			* "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			* Bows not being enchantable
			* Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			* Ender crystals can now appear in some loot chests (somewhat rare)
			* Harvest level tooltips to ores
			* Silent's Mechanisms crusher recipe for ender ore

			* Corrupted slimes ignoring light levels
			## [3.4.0] - 2019-09-15

			* Slime crystal, magma cream crystal, and ender slime crystal (catalyst for gem transmutations)
			* Transmutation altar textures
			* More advancements!
			* Chaos sickness chaos event. Applies some negative effects based on chaos levels, as well as a "chaos sickness" effect which just serves as an indicator.
			### Changed
			* Increase regional gem types from 2-4 to 4-6 (should make finding Nether/End gems a bit easier)
			### Fixed
			* Fix crash when using Naturally Charged Creepers [#406]
			## [3.3.13] - 2019-09-11
			### Changed
			* Adds a more helpful message to the ChaosSourceCapability crash, which should help point users in the correct direction. This is usually caused by client-side mods on the server.

			### Added
			* Configs to disable individual chaos events. Note that disabling events will likely increase the odds of other events occurring. Does not effect events triggered by commands.
			* New lightning event which spawns a series of lightning bolts which do NOT ignite fires. ID is `silentgems:chaos_lightning`. The old event has been renamed to `silentgems:lightning`.
			### Fixed
			* Gem glass on wrong render layer
			* Unlinked redstone teleporters throwing an exception when powered [#395]
			## [3.3.10]
			### Added
			* Transmutation altar. Processes recipes that take one input, one catalyst (not consumed), and produces one output. Generates chaos when working. Recipes can be added with data packs.
			### Changed
			* Nether star shards are produced in the transmutation altar now (resolves potential conflicts)
			### Fixed
			* Enchantment token crash with mod-added enchantment types [#394]
			## [3.3.9]
			Requires Silent Gear 1.3.9 or higher (if installed)
			### Added
			* Gear items crafted with supercharged parts will receive a "Supercharged" name prefix
			### Changed
			* Gear souls can now affect other stats, including repair efficiency and ranged damage/speed
			### Fixed
			* Gear souls not saving their data in some cases
			* Wisps spawning indoors (maybe?)
			## [3.3.8] - 2019-08-18
			### Added
			* Crusher recipes for gem ores (Silent's Mechanisms)
			* Recipe for amazonite also included (Slurpie's Dongles)
			* Recipes will load only if relevant mods are installed.
			## [3.3.7] - 2019-08-17
			### Added
			* Gem bag item. Stores anything in the `forge:gems` tag (all gems and such). Items picked up off the ground will be placed in bags first.
			* Glowrose basket item. Stores glowroses (`silentgems:glowroses`). Works the same way as gem bags.
			* Gem glass can now color beacon beams
			* Proper model for token enchanter (just a recolored supercharger for now)
			* Textures for insulated and grounded effects (by starmute)
			### Changed
			* Nerfed persistence trait (it was ticking much more often than intended)
			## [3.3.6] - 2019-08-13
			### Changed
			* Rebalanced chaos values for events. World chaos is once again added to player chaos, but with some exceptions. If player chaos is low and world chaos is high, the world chaos is replaced with the current equilibrium level. This should allow wisps to spawn rarely for players who are not producing chaos. Most events have too high of a minimum to trigger on the equilibrium level alone.
			### Fixed
			* Chaos rune recipes not producing valid runes
			* Empty pedestals absorbing chaos
			* Crash when placing soul urns in place of tall grass
			## [3.3.5] - 2019-08-12
			### Added
			* Cooldown timers to chaos events. Varies by event, from around 30 seconds to 20 minutes. Once an event is triggered for a player, the same event cannot trigger again until the cooldown expires. These timers are not stored in NBT, so they will reset when the game/server is restarted.
			* Some return home charm config options
			* Option to restrict to teleporters of the same gem (disabled by default)
			* Option to allow binding to anchors (enabled by default)
			* Option to set max uses (0/unlimited by default)
			* Amazonite gear part (Slurpie's Dongles)
			### Changed
			* Rebalanced some chaos-related stuff again
			* Wisps should be less common (min chaos 200k)
			* Corrupted blocks should be slightly more common (min chaos 750k)
			* Events are now rolled every second (up from every 5), makes cooldown times more sensible
			* Reduced chance of fire/lightning wisp shots lighting blocks on fires
			### Fixed
			* World chaos affecting chaos events for all players
			## [3.3.4] - 2019-08-11
			### Fixed
			* Crash when breaking soul urns [#391]
			## [3.3.3] - 2019-08-11
			### Added
			* Recipe for perfect chaos orb (may still change, feedback would be appreciated)
			* Recipes for most vacuum and planter soul urn upgrades
			* Planter soul urn upgrade model/texture, name [#386]
			* Thunderstorm chaos event (very low probability, minimum 1 million chaos)
			### Changed
			* Wisp colors now match their element
			* Increased odds of wisps spawning
			* Improved token enchanter's ingredient detection. It can now merge item stacks together if needed.
			### Fixed
			* Soul urns losing the "lidless" property when harvested
			* Lidless soul urn items not rendering correctly
			* Supercharger processing items that are already supercharged
			* HWYLA reporting the names of gem blocks incorrectly [#390]
			* Wisps trying to spawn on peaceful difficulty
			## [3.3.2] - 2019-08-06
			### Changed
			* Non-vanilla dimensions will now spawn classic gems in a "regional" style (similar to the Nether and The End).
			### Fixed
			* Recipe book crash on Forge 28.0.28+ [#385]
			* Supercharging in JEI showing items transforming into other items
			## [3.3.1] - 2019-07-28
			* Updated for Silent Gear 1.3.2
			## [3.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			### Added
			* A new set of hostile mobs, wisps. These will occasionally spawn on the surface near the player, depending on chaos levels. There are a few different types, each firing a projectile with a different effect.
			* Chaos meter item. Measures player and world chaos levels, sneak + right-click to change modes.
			* Config to override the "base biome seed", which will change which biomes gems will spawn in.
			* Tags for corruptable stone/dirt
			* Missing textures and models for corrupted piles and corrupting/purifying powder
			* Corrupting/purifying powder to some chest loot tables
			### Changed
			* Log biomes for gems in a more compact more, should appear in latest.log
			* Default soul urn capacity is now 54 (6 rows), upgrade has no effect right now
			* Sol and Luna traits now deal much more bonus damage, but with only a 25% chance of activating. Added knockback to sol/luna procs.
			### Fixed
			* Secret donuts kicking players from servers [#381]
			## [3.2.2] - 2019-07-05
			### Changed
			* Soul gem drop rates receive a small bonus from looting
			* Fluffy puffs and fluffy puff seeds can be placed in the composter

			* Hardened stone generating over the ocean [#379]
			* Information on chaos buffs (runes for chaos gems) is now synced with the client
			## [3.2.1] - 2019-07-03
			### Fixed
			* Token enchanter recipes preventing server connection [#378]
			* JEI plugin failing to load on servers
			## [3.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Update to Minecraft 1.14.3
			### Added
			* Gems added to some loot tables
			### Fixed
			* Teleporters and return home charms not working
			## [3.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			* Treasure Bags support (adds bags for gem sets, no way to obtain aside from commands yet)
			* A new command, `sg_soul`. Can currently be used to give soul gems or get a list of all registered souls.
			### Changed
			* Token enchanter recipes now use the vanilla recipe system, so they have moved to the recipes folder. `type` is `silentgems:token_enchanting`, the format is the same otherwise.
			* Updated gem shard textures
			### Fixed
			* Soul gem ingredient not working correctly
			## [3.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			(would have been 3.1.1, Git had other plans)
			Minimum Silent Gear version: 1.1.2
			### Added
			* Gem geodes are back. These are deposits of gems that are encased in hardened rock. There are classic, dark, and light variants, all found in the overworld.
			* Gem ores in the Nether and The End now spawn in "regions", similar to old optional configs. Each region will have 2-4 types of gems.
			* Dark and light glowroses now spawn in the Nether and The End, respectively
			* Implemented traits (some traits are still missing effects)
			* Chaotic - generates chaos when used
			* Entropy - increases block breaking speed depending on chaos levels
			* Luna - attacks deal more damage at night (cancels with Sol)
			* Persistence - slow self-repair
			* Runic - adds damage based on magic damage stat (this will change later)
			* Sol - attacks deal more damage during the day (cancels with Luna)
			### Changed
			* Updated dark gem ores to match new netherrack texture
			* Hardened stone, netherrack, and end stone textures
			* Gear souls no longer gain the armor trait unless on an armor item
			### Fixed
			* Requirements on some advancements (pedestals, hardened rock) [#373]
			* Undyed soul urn recipe not considering gem used
			## [3.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for ender slime spawns are back
			* Recipe advancements for most items (except gem stuff)
			## [3.0.12] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* Silver
			* Corrupting powder and purifying powder. These will create corrupted blocks, or restore them to their normal state. Recipes subject to change.
			### Changed
			* World chaos will now balance at a certain level, instead of zero. The level fluctuates over time.
			* Wild fluffy puff plants will only drop seeds now
			### Fixed
			* Possible fix for [#366]
			* Crash when Silent Gear not installed [#365]
			* Server crash
			## [3.0.11] - 2019-04-14
			### Added
			* Granite, diorite, andesite, and obsidian pedestals. Obsidian pedestal is black-resistant.
			* Chaos gems placed on pedestals will apply effects to nearby players, if enabled. The chaos produced is reduced slightly when applied to multiple players. Chaos gems can be enabled/disabled with redstone.
			* JEI plugin is back
			* Supercharger JEI support, also shows the blocks required for different pillar tiers
			* Token enchanter JEI support
			* Couple of advancements for pedestals
			* (API) IPedestalItem, allows items to be ticked when placed on pedestals
			### Removed
			* Unneeded block items (blocks you would normally never see in your inventory)
			### Changed
			* Pedestals can now accept a redstone signal to control some items.
			* Rebalanced chaos buff costs
			* Add leakage rate to chaos orb tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Pedestals not showing items on world load. Currently fixing this by just sending an update packet occasionally, so you may need to wait a few seconds.
			* Various localization errors
			## [3.0.10] - 2019-04-12
			Add some traits to some gems (still working on this). Many of the new traits do nothing right now.
			### Added
			* Chaos orbs are back. They absorb chaos, but efficiency varies. All orbs have a certain amount of "leakage". They can absorb a fixed amount of chaos, then they break.
			* Pedestals. Currently just a plain stone variety, will likely add more. Right-click to place/remove an item. Holds one item only.
			* Chaos orbs placed on pedestals will absorb chaos produced by nearby blocks
			* Config file (finally)
			### Changed
			* Glowroses spawn in sparser patches (you can tweak this in the config file). You can get the old behavior by setting `glowrose.world.placeTryCount` to 64 and maybe increase `glowrose.world.maxPerPatch`
			* Soul gem average drop rate reduced to 2.5% (from 3.5%). You can change this in the config file.
			## [3.0.9] - 2019-03-21
			### Added
			* Gear souls (formerly tool souls) are back! These work with Silent Gear items only. Soul skills are now learnable traits. Currently no way to customize the skill list, but it will likely happen. This means ANY trait could be made learnable, even user-defined traits.
			* New potion effects, grounded and insulated. These protect from the shocking and freezing effects (caused by the lightning/ice aspect enchantments). No way to get these effects yet.
			### Fixed
			* A server crash (EntityPlayerSP in ChaosGem)
			* Crash when Silent Gear is not loaded
			* Fluffy puffs not growing [#360]
			* Life Steal, Lightning Aspect, and Ice Aspect not working (Gravity still seems off)
			## [3.0.8] - 2019-03-16
			### Added
			* Chaos gems and chaos runes are back. Both are crafted in the token enchanter.
			* More advancements (supercharger pillar tiers, teleporters, and more)
			* Teleporter linker recipe
			* Ender slime spawns (plus spawn egg)
			### Changed
			* Enriched chaos crystals are now crafted in the token enchanter (same ingredients)
			* Reorganized some advancements
			### Fixed
			* "Modify soul urn" recipe is working again. Craft a soul urn with a gem or dyes to change its appearance. Dyeing working just like leather armor.
			* Chaos dust is now craftable (and therefore chaos iron)
			* Ender slime loot table
			## [3.0.7] - 2019-03-12
			### Fixed
			* Crash related to soul gems
			## [3.0.6] - 2019-03-12
			### Added
			* Teleporters are back.
			* Return home charms are back. Each gem variant is now a separate item.
			* Soul gems are back, with changes. A soul gem is automatically added for all living entities. Plant soul gems are gone. Elements are randomized and they will probably have nonsense names (TBD). The elements are meaningless until gear souls are added.
			* Soul gem ingredient for use in recipes. This allows vanilla shaped/shapeless recipes and token enchanter recipes to require a soul gem of a specific entity. See the wiki for details if you want to take advantage of this ~~(politely yell at me on Discord if I have forgotten to write the wiki page)~~.
			* You can now create spawn eggs in the token enchanter. Requires eggs, soul gems, and enriched chaos crystals (you can view the recipes in REI)
			* `sg_chaos` command can now target the world
			### Fixed
			* Ornate gold and silver rods crashing the game
			* `sg_chaos get` command now works correctly
			## [3.0.5] - 2019-03-09
			### Added
			* New chaos system. This is no longer an energy system, but more like a "pollution" system. Certain blocks and items (token enchanter, supercharger) will generate chaos. Chaos will dissipate naturally over time. Currently, there is no way to increase the dissipation rate. If chaos gets too high, you may see random lightning strikes or discover patches of corrupted stone or dirt underground. More effects are planned.
			* Token enchanter. This is the new way of creating enchantment tokens. It supports loading recipes from data packs (place the files in `data/*/silentgems/token_recipes`, where `*` is your data pack's namespace). These recipes are not limited to enchantment tokens, you could use it to create anything.
			* Partial REI support for token enchanter and supercharger. Speed crafting (shift-click to transfer ingredients) is _not_ supported at this time.
			* Wild fluffy puff plants to provide a source of seeds. Can be found in most (not all) biomes that get rain.
			* All foods have their respective effects again (try the donuts!)
			### Fixed
			* Gems missing rarity stat (Silent Gear) [#358]
			* Foods will return items again (sticks, bowls)
			## [3.0.4] - 2019-03-02
			### Added
			* Supercharger is back, along with full Silent Gear integration
			* Fluffy blocks are back
			* Advancements are back
			* Color handlers are back. Wrapped in a try-catch to (hopefully) prevent crashes.
			* Lots of missing recipes
			### Changed
			* Overhauled the localization file, minimizing duplication. Should make translating the mod easier.
			### Fixed
			* Soul urns should be fully functional (but cannot be crafted in survival due to lack of soul gem drops)
			* Ender crystal block effect was missing
			* Chaos coal blocks not working as fuel
			* Broken translations
			## [3.0.3] - 2019-02-24
			### Added
			* Null check for BlockColors and ItemColors. For some reason, these turn up null at random. This should prevent the crash when it happens but certain blocks or items may be missing their colors.
			## [3.0.2] - 2019-02-23
			### Added
			* Glowroses can now be planted in vanilla flower pots. This amplifies their light level to 15.
			* Chaos and Ender ore generation
			### Fixed
			* Nether and End gems not spawning. Currently, both will spawn multi-gem ore. The overworld still has biome-dependent spawns.
			* Glowrose hit box and collision fixed
			* Silent Gear part files corrected. These should function correctly whenever Gear is ready to release.
			## [3.0.1] - 2019-02-21
			### Fixed
			* Crash caused by a build error [#354]
			## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-21
			Ported to 1.13.2. This version will bring some major changes:
			* The Flattening has changed almost every block and item ID. Old worlds are not compatible.
			* Tools and armor have been removed.
			* For a similar system, check out Silent Gear.
			* I am considering a mod which will add simple, non-upgradeable gem tools.
			* The chaos system is gone, for now. I am working on an alternative. Chaos was never intended to be an energy system and I hope to make it into something more interesting.

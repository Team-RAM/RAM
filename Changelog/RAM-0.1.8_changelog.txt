This should make it have a lot better support for multitank fluid tank items. Also improves handling of creative fluid tanks when it comes to stacking tank blocks vertically. Note: filling stacked tanks from the bottom via the gui with buckets is currently broken, should be fixed in the next commit[1e638dd](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1e638dd1d9aa18bcfb042c64dab987dd038ead87)- Cleanup a few method calls, and fix filling stacked tanks via the FluidInventorySlot[4a43200](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4a4320075d37f74f80ff98f5a18cf93cc1e494ab)- Change fluidic plenisher to use BlockPos instead of Coord4D.

There is still more cleanup we can do at some point to CapabilityUtils, but for now the code is easier to read and has less lambda soup when viewing the code via profilers[11ea337](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/11ea33796d6b703d4825d57e14db8d4a7e9a540d)- Further optimizations to Pathfinder for TransporterPathfinder. We now cache the various chunks for all the spots we are looking up TileEntities (not forcing them to generate/load) and quick lookup if we already have an instance of that chunk rather than having to redo all the calculations of getting a chunk to be able to look up the TileEntity in a specific spot[f381030](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/f38103000e6c6d13d540ab8ab61a1bf925dd8717)- Update TOP compat, and remove some old API/IMC handling code for recipe changing as addons/mods that want to register recipes can use data packs, and the code was commented out anyways not doing anything[bb5dfa2](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/bb5dfa29b78fdcddf4881bebf04ceda8b1d99266)- Add back water vapor for now to fix various recipes, and will figure out how we want to handle steam/water vapor more properly again in the future.[#5823](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5823)[02c02f6](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/02c02f618949da3faee6a301fdac98e5fb6194dc)- Bump version to 9.9.7[a5c433d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/a5c433d58b5ec51b85bc5252a566b5f8668d47f9)- Small cleanup for checking event/logical sides and fix retrogen not actually working[#5778](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5778)[c85b7fa](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/c85b7fad9195f39f864374da344cd6b11bea7f63)- Improve getBufferWithFallback for handling of types that have nonnull buffers and instead have an empty type. Also make it so the mechanical pipe can properly pull out of secondary tanks if the primary tank has a different fluid type than we have stored in the pipe[1892401](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/18924015f07d8d9394b1fc27b951e0b6252dac32)- Fix scrolling to change configurator mode requiring two ticks instead of one if the scroll direction is the opposite of the previous scroll direction[2ef579c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/2ef579c8a03b20e2eebad0a6431abb71b8a97003)- Fix walkie talkie model overrides, and the channel not being able to be changed[abb9eac](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/abb9eaca810b5a2a3fc59945f887a486b0d72e9d)- Initial work on getting cardboard boxes working again[#5772](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5772). They seem to work fine, though the blacklist still needs to be reimplemented/rewritten[03a2c37](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/03a2c37d4e98a2b09a51ea398efa09f0bb8c2e3f)- Move cardboard box blacklist to a config option for mod scale disabling, and a tag for per block disabling. This completes reimplementing the cardboard box[#5772](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5772)[5c56a33](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/5c56a33d0026baf66783ca1b89e8116e16ba53bd)- Improve multitank handling for items that fluid tanks can accept[ccbebfa](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ccbebfa64ff9429995f52ad78de9805a2a808196)- Fix improper handling of empty gas stacks with the gas network.[#5837](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5837)[857be2f](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/857be2f71450cb9eb5770d5b482e93a4d7585898)- Have our glass blocks more closely mimic Vanilla's glass in what methods they override[#5840](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5840)[295966e](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/295966e66d83fd628b5d6364ca078d4009a1a1a6)- Rewrite handling of fluid tank inventory slots and how right clicking on fluid tanks with fluid item handlers handles getting the fluids. This should make it have a lot better support for multitank fluid tank items. Also improves handling of creative fluid tanks when it comes to stacking tank blocks vertically. Note: filling stacked tanks from the bottom via the gui with buckets is currently broken, should be fixed in the next commit[1e638dd](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/1e638dd1d9aa18bcfb042c64dab987dd038ead87)- Cleanup a few method calls, and fix filling stacked tanks via the FluidInventorySlot[4a43200](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/4a4320075d37f74f80ff98f5a18cf93cc1e494ab)- Change fluidic plenisher to use BlockPos instead of Coord4D. Still needs to be rewritten to better support things that can be fluid loggable[269bec0](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/269bec090ad02bb33ac3c2e55a9703ebc76ff604)- Bump version to 9.9.8

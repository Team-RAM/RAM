(most likely will only have things start charging/discharging that previously were discharging/charging) - Remove dummy internal slots from the factories that were previously used for changing factory type, and were replaced with dummy slots to avoid breaking compat until we were breaking persistence in more spots. I would highly recommend emptying all factories you may have - Moved the energy slot in factories and the formulaic assemblicator to being "added" after all the other slots[#5751](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5751)[ebf079c](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/ebf079c3f00774a06582e98f0fb41bd49a294d48)- Improves handling of keybinds and fixes issues with having sneak bound to mouse keys[#5920](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5920)[7655a3d](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/7655a3d312b2251614d368b3ae992058d8bff8e0)- Fix a few of the issues with rate limited handlers, and also improve special case handling for fluid tanks/dynamic tanks where their inventory slots function is based on contents[8f81027](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/8f81027959c4fe84ba5facaae1c80861b19d97a8)- Fix persistence of multiblock fluid tanks[096aeb7](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/096aeb777e1b26b2ac635445e9748b187f2a428d)- Rate limit how quickly fluid and gas tanks can fill items/be filled by items. This does not change the rate at which they can be interacted with via pipes/tubes[f1fd4a5](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/f1fd4a5f8550b255a63bf7a01805ff8e1fbe9668)- Properly override growStack in FluidTankFluidTank to be able to handle stacked fluid tanks. I don't think this method is actually called from anywhere, but just in case it is it is good to make sure it is implemented properly[be75722](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/be7572223f920e84c3b18d018bd188644a003df2)- Make hud provider pass equipment slot type, so that armor can filter itself out when it is only in the player's hand[fb73a56](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/fb73a56e7ef8b488e7f323f483ce4373171da600)- Allow items in forge:wrenches to be treated as basic wrenches by our blocks[a4ea8c2](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/a4ea8c2c5d37b078733f2bae1859b3b496d83db6)- Bump version to 9.9.12

	Ores Above Diamonds (	Ores Above Diamonds 1.15 - v3.1.1 --> Ores Above Diamonds 1.15 - v3.2):
		Ores Above Diamonds 1.15 - v3.2:
			- Changed the Amethyst texture to the one created by Poland123456. Many thanks to him.
			- In order to fit the quality of the new amethyst texture, I cleaned up the black opal texture as well. The glow was not symmetrical and was dirty looking. Now it is more vibrant. Additionally, black opal ore's give a slight glow.
			- Significantly nerfed the default spawn chance for the end ores as a result of fixing compatibility to spawn the outer end islands. This nerf can be manually reverted in the config file by increasing the chance back. The last version (v3.1) didn't have this nerf and could be OP if you enabled end ores.
			- There is also a version for 1.14.4 players.
			Cheers!

			## [1.3.11] - 2019-09-10
			### Changed
			- Data paths for parts and traits changed. silentgear/parts is now silentgear_parts and silentgear/traits is now silentgear_traits. Files in the old location will still load for now.
			### Fixed

			- Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			- A joke part: barrier
			### Changed
			- Part names and prefixes are now serialized like vanilla text (`translate` to translate, `text` for literal text). Old part files will load correctly.
			- Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed
			- Armor not using blended colors
			- Should fix barrier items being produced when salvaging some items
			## [1.3.9] - 2019-08-19
			### Added
			- Gear name prefixes. Can be added to individual parts (see rough rods for any example), or through an event (GearNamePrefixesEvent)
			### Changed

			- Mine and Slash random drops should now be salvagable
			### Fixed

			## [1.3.8] - 2019-08-13
			### Fixed
			- Mine and Slash compatibility race condition
			## [1.3.7] - 2019-08-13
			### Added
			- Basic compatibility for Mine and Slash
			### Fixed
			- Parts blacklisted for "all" gear types not actually being blacklisted
			## [1.3.6] - 2019-08-12
			### Added
			- Stat multiplier configs for gear. These allow the stat values of all items to be increased or decreased without overwriting every part file.
			- Gear type blacklist to part tooltips
			- Texture for phantom light item, translated name [#44]
			### Fixed
			- Ranged damage stat being ignored
			## [1.3.5] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Fixed
			- Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases... for real this time [#45]
			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			- Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs
			- A couple more advancements
			- Sort button to parts GUI. This is no longer a drop down list, it just cycles the options (just wanted a quick fix for right now)
			### Fixed
			- Parts with malformed JSON not raising an error (may not detect all cases still...) [#41]
			- Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			- Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			- Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			- Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			- Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			- Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			- The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			- Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			- Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			- Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			- A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			- Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			- Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			- Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			- Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			- Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			- Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			- Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			- Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			- Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			- Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			- Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			- Traits not loading on OS X
			- Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			- Some armor textures being broken
			- Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			- New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			- Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			- Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			- Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			- Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			- Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			- Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			- Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			- Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			- Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			- Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			- Blended head colors including non-main parts
			- Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24
			JEI plugin is up to date. Recommended Forge is 26.0.51 or later.
			### Added
			- A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			- Small change to trait level calculations
			- Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			- Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			- Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			- Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			- Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			- Netherwood slabs and stairs
			- Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			- New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			- Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			- Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			- Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			- Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			- Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			- Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			- Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			- Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			- Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			- Bow "lite" models are animated now
			- Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			- Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			- Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			- Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			- Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			- Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			- Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			- Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			- Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			- JEI plugin has been updated
			### Fixed
			- "Unknown part type" error when connecting to servers
			- Bows not being enchantable
			- Blocks connecting to analyzers improperly
			## [1.0.8] - 2019-04-15
			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			- Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			- Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			- Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			- Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			- Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			- Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			- Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			- Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			- Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			- Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			- Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			- Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			- Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			- Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			- Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			- Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			- Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			- Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			- (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			- Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			- Example gear generates correctly
			- Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			- Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			- A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			- Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			- Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			- World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			- Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			- Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			- Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			- Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			- Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			- Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			- Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			 - Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			 - You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			- Traits are broken right now
			- None of the blocks function yet

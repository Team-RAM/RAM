			# Changelog
			The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/]()),
			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).
			## [1.7.2] - 2020-06-05
			### Added
			* Moar new traits!
			* Cursed - Reduces luck. Cancels with Lucky. Max level 7, same as Lucky.
			* Magnetic - Pulls in nearby items, range based on level
			* Terminus - Creates and places stone blocks, costs 1 durability per use
			* A couple of secret traits of questionable usefulness...
			* Shears (NOTE: these do not function correctly because of missing Forge patches!) [#103]
			* `/sgear_mats` command for interacting with new WIP material system (currently unused)
			### Changed
			* The `silentgear:refractive` trait type has been replaced with `silentgear:block_placer`, which can be made to place any block!
			### Fixed
			* Flammable's item destroyed message not giving the item name
			* Shields not being enchantable
			## [1.7.1] - 2020-05-29
			### Added
			* Flammable trait (only on wood by default). Flammable items take damage if the player is on fire and the item is equipped. They can also be used as fuel in furnaces, with the burn time being proportional to the item's durability.
			### Fixed
			* Attribute traits (Lucky) stacking each time item is equipped [#129]
			* Parts GUI not displaying stats correctly [#128]
			## [1.7.0] - 2020-05-20
			### Added
			* Command to export part data to a TSV file, `/sgear_parts dump`. A TSV file can be imported into any spreadsheet program.
			* Spoon trait. This allows any part to function like a spoon upgrade. It will only work on pickaxes, same as before.
			* Crushing trait. Increases armor and decreases attack damage as gear is damaged.
			* ru_ru.json lang file (vanja-san) [#118]
			### Changed
			* Reworked some gear tooltip stuff. Synergy is under stats. Traits are more clearly labeled.
			* (API) - Stats are now a Forge registry and should be registered using the Register event.
			* Stat names with the `silentgear` namespace can continue to omit the namespace in JSON files, others should include it.
			* The stat multiplier config settings are currently broken
			### Fixed
			* Balanced armor and shield repairs (now based on armor durability stat) [#123]
			* Blueprint paper recipe not accepting tagged dyes [#122]
			* Duplication of upgrade parts in some cases [#121]
			* `silentgear:has_part` and `silentgear:has_trait` loot conditions not working for weapons
			## [1.6.4] - 2020-05-13
			### Added
			* Indestructible trait, prevents durability loss (not found on any default part for now, but the trait does work)

			* Bows and crossbows displaying "When in main hand" with no modifiers
			## [1.6.3] - 2020-05-07
			### Changed
			* Shield durability is now based on the "armor durability" stat. Iron shields should be the same durability as vanilla shields.
			* Reworked the way stat modifiers are read from part JSONs. Old files are still compatible. New style is less verbose.
			### Fixed
			* Shield models in wrong location (Partonetrain) [#117]
			* Shields not having any color [#114]
			* Netherwood sticks will no longer lower durability below 20
			* Multiple modifiers on a single stat for a part not working
			## [1.6.2] - 2020-05-02
			### Fixed
			* Possible crash with armor and Quark [#115]
			* Possible solution for CME in PartManager [#104]
			* "Add harvest level" stat modifiers not working (ornate gold rod from SGems). This moves the "max" operation to right after the "avg" operation. Shouldn't effect stat calculations in most other cases. [#70]
			* Armor showing "When in main hand" in tooltip
			## [1.6.1] - 2020-04-27
			### Added
			* Paxels are back! Requires 5 mains and a rod. Small durability bonus, small penalty to harvest speed and enchantability. [#114]
			* Shields are here (technically). Model currently has issues and colors do not work. Not sure how to fix this just yet. [#114]
			### Fixed
			* Netherwood trees not spawning [#110]
			* A possible lumber axe crash when used on large trees [#84]
			* (API) `PartData.onAddedToGear` being called too often [[Super Multi-Drills #19]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SuperMultiDrills/issues/19))]
			## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-20
			### Added
			* (API) `IGearPart.randomizeData`, creates a PartData object used during random gear generation
			### Changed
			* Move all gear crafting recipes to their own tab in JEI [#106]
			* (API) PartTypes can now specify a fallback part, deprecates `PartManager.tryGetFallback`
			* (API) Gear class maps in ModItems now use ResourceLocations for keys, to allow other mods to add gear types
			### Fixed
			* Swapping gear parts will now attempt to return the replaced parts in the crafting grid
			* Part names being underlined after viewing them in the parts menu
			* Gear randomizer not selecting parts in some cases
			* Random gear command not working with command blocks

			## [1.5.8] - 2020-04-15
			### Fixed
			* Server crash caused by new command added in 1.5.7 [#112]
			* Issues with armor coloring being incorrect, adds a couple new texture properties to part JSONs (see [Silent's Gems #454]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/issues/454)))
			* `armor_color` - The color of the armor model (defaults to `fallback_color`)
			* `armor_texture` - The prefix of the armor texture path (defaults to `texture_suffix`)
			* You can leave these new properties out (default) in most cases
			* This fix disables color blending for armor models (items will still show blending)
			## [1.5.7] - 2020-04-12
			Requires Forge 31.1.18 or higher
			### Added

			### Added
			* Attribute modifier traits. These will apply attribute modifiers to gear items based on the type of gear and the trait level.

			### Fixed
			* Hidden parts appearing on the parts screen in the crafting station
			* Sound type of flax plants
			## [1.3.10] - 2019-09-04
			Update requires Forge 28.0.83 or higher
			### Added
			* A joke part: barrier
			### Changed

			* Part name prefixes no longer nested in `name`, moved to `name_prefix`
			### Fixed

			## [1.3.4] - 2019-08-02
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades should now show up in JEI and creative tabs

			* Tool head swapping restoring durability in some cases [#43]
			* Some armor items missing color
			## [1.3.3] - 2019-07-30
			### Changed
			* Make parsing of part crafting items less strict. The `item` property will be removed if `tag` is present. Undefined tags will no longer prevent the part from loading (but you still won't be able to craft with it, of course)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers destroying the NBT of certain blocks, like shulker boxes and soul urns [Silent's Gems #384]
			* Color handlers crashing the game in some cases [#39]
			## [1.3.2] - 2019-07-28
			### Added
			* Custom tipped upgrades. This is a single item which allows the part to be changed with NBT. Just set "PartID" to the ID of the part. For the crafting items of the part, replace the usual "normal" object with an empty "custom_tipped_upgrade" object. You will need to create the recipe for the upgrade yourself.
			* The "nerfed gear" config is back. Disabled by default. You can set any damageable item to have reduced durability, to encourage use of Silent Gear over vanilla items (or items from other mods if you wish). This may not work for all items.
			### Changed
			* Part analyzer optimized a bit. Should reduce tick time when it's not working.
			* Lite gear models reworked. Added grip layer to tools. Some layers support a very limited set of alternate textures.
			* Internal changes to how parts are detected. May reduce performance slightly in some cases. This was needed for custom tipped upgrades.
			## [1.3.1] - 2019-07-24
			### Added
			* A `hidden` property for traits. Hidden traits will not be shown in the list of traits on an item, unless advanced tooltips (F3+H) are enabled.
			* Trait conditions, which allow conditions to be assigned to traits on parts. The part will not apply the trait to a gear item if the conditions are not met.
			### Fixed
			* Some gear crafting recipes not working [#36]
			* Diamond and glowstone tip upgrades not having the Lustrous trait
			## [1.3.0] - 2019-07-23
			* Update to 1.14.4
			## [1.2.4] - 2019-07-22
			### Fixed
			* Random crash with Silent's Gems
			## [1.2.3] - 2019-07-21
			### Added
			* Config to enable additional logging for loading and syncing parts and traits
			* Tier 3 analyzer catalyst tag (no items in it by default)
			* Recipe to replace the head of a tool. Craft a tool with a tool head (a tool with only main parts). The old head is retained.
			* Spear blueprints to the "swords" loot pool for the blueprint package
			### Changed
			* Trait descriptions are now shown in item tooltips when the Alt key is held down
			* Parts with zero armor durability are automatically blacklisted for armor crafting. Similarly, zero durability will blacklist all other gear types.
			### Fixed
			* Traits not loading on OS X
			* Gear type blacklist for parts now actually works
			* Some armor textures being broken
			* Overrode vanilla's dumb repair recipe again... This disables crafting grid "repairs" of Silent Gear items, but the grindstone still works.
			## [1.2.2] - 2019-07-17
			### Added
			* New trait type, `silentgear:nbt_trait`. This will add arbitrary NBT to gear items when crafted.
			* Missing models for crossbow blueprints and templates
			* Crusher recipes (Silent's Mechanisms) for crimson iron ore
			* Notify players on login of part and trait files that failed to load
			### Changed
			* Trait lists in tooltips tweaked (hopefully they won't be confused for enchantments?)
			* Sickles reset sweet berry bushes to age 1 (same as picking berries from them normally)
			* Machetes can now break multiple bamboo blocks at once
			### Fixed
			* Sickles duplicating dirt from grass blocks, possibly some other related issues
			## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-11
			### Added
			* Crossbows. These have some minor animation issues (because vanilla is dumb), but they function correctly.
			### Changed
			* Random grading now assigns the same grade to all parts. Added a config which can revert to the old behavior.
			### Fixed
			* Some issues with the JEI plugin on servers
			* Blended head colors including non-main parts
			* Possibly improves part analyzer performance
			## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-01
			Updated for Minecraft 1.14.3
			## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-24

			### Added
			* A few new traits, assigned to some existing parts
			### Changed
			* Small change to trait level calculations
			* Blueprint paper recipe now uses the vanilla blue dye item only, until Forge fixes the blue dye tag
			## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-21
			### Added
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_part`, which can check if a gear item has a particular part. Can also check the grade of the part.
			* Loot condition `silentgear:has_trait`, which can check if a gear item has a given trait
			* Gear stat changes are now logged in the debug log. There will be a config for this later, but for right now it is forced on.
			### Fixed
			* Issue where trait data was not being sent completely during client login
			## [1.1.1] - 2019-06-20
			### Added
			* Netherwood slabs and stairs
			* Recipe advancements (most recipes will show in the recipe book when you get certain items)
			* New command, `sgear_random_gear` which will give randomized gear items
			* Loot table function for setting specific parts on a gear item
			* Chinese translation (zh_cn, by XuyuEre)
			### Fixed
			* Example gear items not appearing in the creative tab
			## [1.1.0] - 2019-06-17
			### Added
			* Configs for random grading. You can adjust the mean, standard deviation, and max grade.
			* Gear with mixed main parts will blend the colors, but with much greater weight on earlier parts
			### Removed
			* Blue flower and black/blue dyes (use cornflowers and new vanilla dyes instead)
			### Changed
			* Netherwood tree generation (more leaves, subject to change)
			## [1.0.12] - 2019-05-11
			### Changed
			* Blueprints and templates now have the output item in their name, instead of the tooltip
			### Fixed
			* Stats not calculating correctly in some cases (e.g. tip upgrades) [#27]
			* Bow "lite" models are animated now
			* Rod and bowstring blueprints/templates being consumed during crafting
			## [1.0.11] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Command to recalculate stats on all of a player's gear (can target multiple players)
			* Command to list all registered parts. Also shows how many of each type there are.
			### Fixed
			* Parts and traits should now sync all needed data with clients
			* Fix gear losing their stats during recalculations (e.g. ka-chink)
			* Flax plants not growing
			## [1.0.10] - 2019-05-08
			### Added
			* Config to disable enchanted effect on gear items (this adds a new client config file). Since the effect is broken on vanilla models, this is disabled by default.
			* Spears. They are weaker than swords, but have a much longer reach. These may need some balancing still.
			### Fixed
			* Should fix gear parts and traits not syncing to clients on LAN games
			## [1.0.9] - 2019-04-24
			### Added
			* JEI plugin has been updated

			Small tweak needed by Silent's Gems 3.0.11.
			## [1.0.7] - 2019-04-07
			### Added
			* Analyzer catalyst, which will increase the median grade when grading parts. These are set by item tags and there are two tiers (`silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier1` and `silentgear:analyzer_catalyst/tier2`). By default, tier 1 is glowstone dust, and tier 2 is glittery dust, a new item.
			### Changed
			* Rod-less tools (heads) will now hurt you when used. Ouch!
			* Hammers are no longer effective on "extra materials" like circuits (redstone, ladders) and glass
			* Durability max is now Integer.MAX_VALUE (2^32-1) and Armor Durability max is 1/16th of that (134,217,727)
			### Fixed
			* Hammers breaking unbreakable blocks
			* Parts GUI is working again (access in the crafting station GUI)
			* Some broken/missing translations
			## [1.0.6] - 2019-03-30
			### Added
			* Stone torches (craft with coal/charcoal and stone rods)
			* Potted blue flower and netherwood saplings (just use the block on a flower pot)
			* Flax is obtainable, look for wild flax plants in plains or mountain biomes.
			* Sinew is now obtainable
			### Removed
			* Item of flax plant (block still exists, but you will get a warning on world load)
			### Changed
			* Rewrote gear crafting recipe code to allow recipes to show up in the recipe book and REI (probably JEI as well, have not tested). The recipe JSON files are still the same. If you didn't know, you can completely replace these recipes with data packs!
			* Better temporary models for everything but bows. Still waiting on Forge for the proper model system to come back. These new models will likely become a config option, as they are probably much easier on less powerful hardware.
			### Fixed
			* Block-placing feature is back. Right-click while holding a compatible tool (SGear pickaxe, shovel, or axe by default) to place the block in the slot after the tool, or the last slot of your hotbar. Also works with the torch bandolier (from the Torch Bandolier mod).
			* Lustrous trait being 15 times more powerful than intended. Also increased the bonus from sky light; block light is 75% as effective.
			## [1.0.5] - 2019-03-19
			Tweaks some things which will be needed for the next Silent's Gems release, which will add gear souls (replaces tool souls from older versions). Minor API changes.
			### Added
			* Lock stats command is back
			### Fixed
			* Armor recipes now reference the correct blueprints
			* (Partially) When connecting to a dedicated server, information about traits and gear parts is synced to the client. Unfortunately, this happens too late and tooltips usually do not update.
			## [1.0.4] - 2019-03-08
			Traits are mostly implemented. There are a few that do not function yet, but it should be possible to create custom traits again.
			### Fixed
			* Tools having wrong attack damage and speed modifiers (removed equipment JSON files entirely) [#24]
			* Example gear generates correctly
			* Armor no longer says it's missing a rod
			* Fix armor item color (custom worn armor is still colorless)
			* A few misc tooltip-related issues
			## [1.0.3] - 2019-03-07
			Temporary workaround for Forge issue #5577, Silent Gear [issue #25]([https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/issues/25)). This allows players to connect to servers and LAN games. I have noticed their are issues with gear parts not syncing to the client, which I am pretty sure is unrelated. Gear items can still be crafted and used normally as far as I know, they just look wrong.
			## [1.0.2] - 2019-03-03
			### Added
			* Improved temporary gear models. They do not display upgrades or support unique textures, but... it's something. Now we wait for Forge to fix stuff.
			* Grade argument to "sgear_parts add" command.
			## [1.0.1] - 2019-02-28
			### Added
			* World generation (flowers, netherwood, and crimson iron)
			### Changed
			* Crafting station part slots removed. This leaves just the crafting grid and side storage.
			### Fixed
			* Blocks with GUIs can be opened again
			* Flower and netherwood sapling models corrected
			## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-24
			Port to 1.13.2. Bumped version to 1.0.0 because of major changes, but this is still an alpha of course.
			* Old part files are not compatible and must be updated.
			* Parts are now added with **datapacks**. Files should be in `data/<namespace>/silentgear/parts/`, where `<namespace>` is a unique ID for your datapack. You can organize files into subfolders as well (e.g. have a folder for main parts, a separate folder for rods, etc.) This is optional, but encouraged.
			* Gear **models do not work**, you will see white outlines instead (the items still work, of course)
			* Tool heads removed... sort of. Crafting a blueprint with main parts only creates a rodless tool (head).
			* Tool heads are technically their respective tool. You can use them, but some stats are reduced until you attach a rod. May add additional penalties later.
			* You can also place the tool rod (and bowstring for bows) in the crafting grid at the same time to craft the whole tool in one go!
			* Traits are broken right now
			* None of the blocks function yet

			* Standard tier machine speed to 2.0x (up from 1.5x)
			* Drying rack can be waterlogged (will not function when waterlogged)
			* Set minimum Forge version to 28.1.5
			### Fixed

			* Single wires not functioning [#11]
			## [0.6.4] - 2019-10-10

			### Fixed
			* Lava generator missing its loot table [#26]
			* Other missing loot tables (also added a warning system so the game will yell at me when I forget more in the future)
			* Might fix another wire-related crash [#23]
			## [0.6.2] - 2019-10-01

			* Silent Lib not being correctly listed as a dependency in the mods.toml
			## [0.6.1] - 2019-09-27
			### Added
			* Canisters, stackable fluid containers (64 per slot). This will hold any fluid, but probably won't be recognized by other mods.
			* Fluid color is currently pulled from some JEI code until I write my own solution. If you report colorless fluids in canisters I will make fun of you :p
			* Pump, picks up fluids from the world. Can fill buckets or canisters. Requires some FE to work
			* Refinery is working
			* Refinery can fill buckets or fluid canisters
			* Temporary refinery textures
			* Plastic pellets and sheets (not craftable yet, we're getting there...)
			## [0.6.0] - 2019-09-23

			* Oil, generates in "lakes", usually underground. No function at the moment.
			* Diesel, will be one product of refining oil. Currently no way to produce it.
			* Refinery, not functional. Will refine oil into other fluids. Has a "recipe" system which will allow mods or datapacks to use it.
			### Changed
			* Coal generator now also accepts `forge:nuggets/coal` [#18]
			### Fixed
			* Ores generating in wrong generation stage [#19]
			* Add loot table for basic crusher
			## [0.5.2] - 2019-09-08
			More recipe progression/rebalancing, more to come
			### Added
			* Basic crusher
			* Coal dust
			* Advancements (names and descriptions missing)
			### Changed
			* Steel-like ingot recipes now require coal dust (meaning you need a basic crusher)
			### Fixed
			* Crash when opening machines [#14]
			* Coal generator being uncraftable with new recipe progression [#13]
			* Lava generator not accepting lava if output slot is empty [#12]
			* Add loot table for basic alloy smelter

			* Lava generator consuming lava buckets when full
			## [0.5.0] - 2019-08-30
			Updated for Forge 28.0.74+
			### Added
			* Lava Generator. Creates Forge Energy from lava (anything in the `minecraft:lava` fluid tag). Should interact with fluid pipes from other mods (not tested yet), or you can place lava buckets into its input slot.
			* Yes, the model is broken and the textures are temporary!
			* Currently generates 500K FE per lava bucket (feedback appreciated)
			* Steel recipe [#9]
			* ComputerCraft (CC Tweaked) computers can now read energy levels of machines and generators
			### Changed
			* Generators can now be controlled by redstone like machines (defaults to ignore redstone)
			* Coal generator now accepts only coal and charcoal (`minecraft:coals`) and coal blocks (`forge:storage_blocks/coal`) by default. Override the `silents_mechanisms:coal_generator_fuels` item tag if you need to change this.
			## [0.4.2] - 2019-08-24
			### Added
			* Machines can now be controlled by redstone (defaults to ignore redstone). Does not work on generators yet, expect it next update.
			* Machine frames (no use yet), Electrum
			### Changed
			* Machines are now set to their inactive state (and lose progress) when they run out of power
			### Fixed
			* Alloy smelter matching the wrong recipes
			## [0.4.1] - 2019-08-23
			### Added
			* Wrench item. Rotates some blocks and sets the connection type of wires
			* Wires are now implemented. They still require some work, but are usable.
			### Changed
			* Updated Polish translation (Dolores_McDoodle)
			### Fixed
			* Blocks losing their inventory when broken [#4]
			## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-22
			* Big thanks to EnbyChu for making all the textures for this update!
			* This is a very large update (over 400 JSON files) because of the addition of ores. Expect recipes to be changes to use the new metals.
			### Added
			* Metal ores (with configs, including a convenient "master switch" to disable them all at once)
			* Metal blocks and nuggets
			* Zinc, bismuth, brass, bismuth brass, aluminum (bauxite), and uranium

			### Added
			* JEI support for drying rack
			### Changed
			* Tweaked display of some recipes in JEI (cut empty space on crusher category, fix clipping on compressor category)
			## [0.3.0] - 2019-08-06
			Updated for Forge 28.0.45
			### Added
			* Drying racks. These have their own recipes, so mods or data packs can add recipes.

			* Recipe for alloy smelter
			* JEI support for alloy smelter
			* Some missing models, textures, and localized names

		theoneprobe-1.15-2.0.3.jar:
			* Fixed a problem when looking at certain entities (like paintings). There would be massive console spam
			* Fixed a small problem with IProbeHitEntityData not doing what it promised

			* Allow facade/cable rendering in all layers, ensuring that translucency works in addition to cutouts and solids.
			* Always render the cable even if there is also a facade, so that translucent and cutout blocks show the cable inside.
